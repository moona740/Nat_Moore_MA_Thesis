cribbage board, garlic press

suction, lacks grip.
bungee cord, bootstrap,
dog leash, leather belt
because this window had sash cords.
they frayed. they broke.
feather duster, thatch of straw, empty
bottle of elmer's glue
because this window is loud—its hinges clack
open, clack shut.
stuffed bear, baby blanket,
single crib newel
because this window is split. it's dividing

velvet moss, sagebrush,
willow branch, robin's wing
because this window, it's pane-less. it's only

the old cupola glinted above the clouds, shone
among fir trees, but it took him an hour
for the half mile all the way up the hill. as he trailed,
the village passed him by, greeted him,
asked about his health, but everybody hurried
to catch the mass, left him leaning against fences,
measuring the road with the walking stick he sculpted.
he yearned for the day when the new church
would be built—right across the road. now
it rises above the moon: saints in frescoes
meet the eye, and only the rain has started to cut
through the shingles on the roof of his empty
house. the apple trees have taken over the sky,
sequestered the gate, sidled over the porch.

look for me under the hood
of that old chevrolet settled in weeds
at the end of the pasture.
i'm the radiator that spent its years
bolted in front of an engine
shoving me forward into the wind.
whatever was in me in those days
has mostly leaked away,
but my cap's still screwed on tight
and i know the names of all these
tattered moths and broken grasshoppers
the rest of you've forgotten.

behind the silo, the mother rabbit
hunches like a giant spider with strange calm:
six tiny babies beneath, each
clamoring for a sweet syringe of milk.
this may sound cute to you, reading
from your pulpit of plenty,
but one small one was left out of reach,
a knife of fur
barging between the others.
i watched behind a turret of sand. if
i could have cautioned the mother rabbit
i would. if i could summon the
bunnies to fit him in beneath
the belly's swell
i would. but instead, i stood frozen, wishing
for some equity. this must be
why it's called wild life because of all the
crazed emotions tangled up in
the underbrush within us.
did i tell you how
the smallest one, black and trembling,
hopped behind the kudzu
still filigreed with wanting?
should we talk now of animal heritage, their species,
creature development? and what do we say
about form and focus—
writing this when a stray goes hungry, and away.

you fly off the handle,
old skin and bones,
black bat wing.

so fierce in her advocacy
on behalf of
the most vulnerable child
who'll catch his death
in this tempest.
such a headwind!
sometimes it requires
all my strength
just to end a line.
but when the wind is at
my back, we're likely
to get carried away, and say
something we can never retract,
something saturated from the ribs
down, an old stony
word like ruin. you're what roof
i have, frail thing,
you're my argument
against the whole sky.
you're the fundamental difference
between wet and dry.

you are the start of the week
or the end of it, and according
to the beatles you creep in
like a nun. you're the second
full day the kids have been
away with their father, the second
full day of an empty house.
sunday, i've missed you. i've been
sitting in the backyard with a glass
of pinot waiting for your arrival.
did you know the first sweet 100s
are turning red in the garden,
but the lettuce has grown
too bitter to eat. i am looking
up at the bluest sky i have ever seen,
cerulean blue, a heaven sky
no one would believe i was under.
you are my witness. no day
is promised. you are absolution.
you are my unwritten to-do list,
my dishes in the sink, my brownie
breakfast, my braless day.

is anything central?
orchards flung out on the land,
urban forests, rustic plantations, knee-high hills?
are place names central?
elm grove, adcock corner, story book farm?
as they concur with a rush at eye level
beating themselves into eyes which have had enough
thank you, no more thank you.
and they come on like scenery mingled with darkness
the damp plains, overgrown suburbs,
places of known civic pride, of civil obscurity.
these are connected to my version of america
but the juice is elsewhere.
this morning as i walked out of your room
after breakfast crosshatched with
backward and forward glances, backward into light,
forward into unfamiliar light,
was it our doing, and was it
the material, the lumber of life, or of lives
we were measuring, counting?
a mood soon to be forgotten
in crossed girders of light, cool downtown shadow
in this morning that has seized us again?
i know that i braid too much on my own
snapped-off perceptions of things as they come to me.
they are private and always will be.
where then are the private turns of event
destined to bloom later like golden chimes
released over a city from a highest tower?
the quirky things that happen to me, and i tell you,
and you know instantly what i mean?
what remote orchard reached by winding roads
hides them? where are these roots?
it is the lumps and trials
that tell us whether we shall be known
and whether our fate can be exemplary, like a star.
all the rest is waiting
for a letter that never arrives,
day after day, the exasperation
until finally you have ripped it open not knowing what it is,
the two envelope halves lying on a plate.
the message was wise, and seemingly
dictated a long time ago, but its time has still
not arrived, telling of danger, and the mostly limited
steps that can be taken against danger
now and in the future, in cool yards,
in quiet small houses in the country,
our country, in fenced areas, in cool shady streets.

hour in which i consider hydrangea, a salt or sand plant, varietal, the question of varietals, the diet of every mother i know, 5 pounds feels like 20, i have lost … i have lost, yes, a sense of my own possible beauty, grown external, i externalize beauty. beauty occurs on the surface of plants; the sun darkens the skin of my child, he is so small, he is beautiful (i can see; it is obvious) and everything about him is beautiful. his hand swells from the bite [spread?] of some insect[’s] venom because he is small. he appears to feel nothing. he smashes his skull against the floor. he screams. i hold him in my lap on the kitchen floor in front of an open freezer, pressing a pack of frozen clay against his forehead. he likes the cold. i see; it is so obvious. hydrangea. when i move, when i walk pushing my child’s stroller (it is both walking and pushing or hauling, sometimes, also, lifting; it is having another body, an adjunct body composed of errand and weight and tenderness and no small amount of power), i imagine i can feel this small amount of weight, this 5 pounds like 20, interfering with the twitch of every muscle in my body. as an object, a mother is confusing, a middle-aged mother with little spare flesh, i feel every inch of major muscle pulling against gravity and against the weight of my child, now sleeping. this is the hour for thinking hydrangea. let no man look at me. i stop to brush the drowsy child’s little eye. his face. he barely considers his mother. i am all around him. why should he consider what is all around him? perhaps what is missing is a subtle power of differentiation. i am in, therefore, a time of mass apprehensions.

she couldn't help but sting my finger,
clinging a moment before i flung her
to the ground. her gold is true, not the trick
evening light plays on my roses.
she curls into herself, stinger twitching,
gilt wings folded. her whole life just a few weeks,
and my pain subsided in a moment.
in the cold, she hardly had her wits to buzz.
no warning from either of us:
she sleeping in the richness of those petals,
then the hand, my hand, cupping the bloom
in devastating force, crushing the petals for the scent.
and she mortally threatened, wholly unaware
that i do this daily, alone with the gold last light,
in what seems to me an act of love.

i will not speak ill of jack flick.
i will rarely look
at the scar he made on my cheek
one summer at the lake.
i won't speak ill of jack whose freckles
and gangly legs are gone.
so is the drained face i saw when he saw
what he'd done with a sharp rock
nonchalantly skipped.
i will speak well, for it was somewhat
sweet to lie on the dock while jack
and his friends bent down
and wiped my face with a sandy towel.
i will speak well of them,
for most are gone
and the wound proved small.
i will speak well, for the rock
missed my eye. i can hardly find
the scar. jack went into the air

retired, and lived less than a year
before his tender heart gave out.

the wind twills
through the uppermost tier

now the song of a bird
like the squeaky lock
over a canoe's oar,
followed by startling chirps,
the sky pushing its clouds
like sailboats,
and i think, what kind of god

we have to seek, as children do
for something like the beetle
scuttling between grass,

you think we are the pointed argument,
the man drunk at the party showing off
his gun collection, the bed of nettles.
what we really are is hidden from you:
girl weeping in the closet among her stepfather's boots;
tuft of rabbit fur caught in barbed wire; body of the baby
in the landfill; boy with the shy mouth playing his guitar
at the picnic table, out in the dirt yard.
we slide into this world benign and pliable,
quills pressed down smooth over back and tail.
only one hour here stiffens the barbs into thousands
of quick retorts. everything this well-guarded
remembers being soft once.

i planted an apple tree in memory
of my mother, who is not gone,
but whose memory has become
so transparent that she remembers
slicing apples with her grandmother
(yellow apples; blue bowl) better than
the fruit that i hand her today. still,
she polishes the surface with her thumb,
holds it to the light and says with no
hesitation, oh, yellow transparent . . . 
they're so fragile, you can almost see to the core. she no longer remembers how
to roll the crust, sweeten the sauce, but
her desire is clear—it is pie that she wants.
and so, i slice as close as i dare to the core—
to that little cathedral to memory—where
the seeds remember everything they need
to know to become yellow and transparent.

the entrance at the back of the complex
led onto a road, where an upended couch
tilted into a ditch and a washing machine
gleamed avocado beneath pine needles.
from the end, you turned left and left again,
then cut a trail to find the cul-de-sac
of bright brick houses. we'd walk as far
as we dared before a man pushing a mower
might stop to ask, "whadda you boys need?"
that was a question we could never answer.
i loved the name of the place, white hall,
imagined that each interior was a stretch
of marble perfect wall adorned by smiling
photos of the family. our own halls
were brailled with nail holes of former
tenants, the spackled rounds of fists.
but doesn't longing clarify the body?
the boys i left behind: tommy, wearing
the world war ii trenching tool;
danny, whose father, so much older
than the other parents, died in his recliner
one sunny afternoon while watching baseball;
duke, who stole his mother's car and crashed
into a wall. boys who knew when you were posing,
waiting for someone to say, "smile." boys
who, on those latch-key days, held themselves
in narrow passages when no one
was there to show them what to do.

why are you still seventeen
and drifting like a dog after dark,
dragging a shadow you’ve found?
put it back where it belongs,
and that bend of river, too. that’s not the road
you want, though you have it to yourself.
gone are the cars that crawl to town
from the reactors, a parade of insects, metallic,
fuming along the one four-lane street.
the poplars of the shelterbelt lean away
from the bypass that never had much to pass by
but coyote and rabbitbrush.
pinpricks stabbed in a map too dark to read—
i stared at stars light-years away.
listen. that hissing? just a sprinkler
damping down yesterday until it’s today.

every leaf rustling as if it’s the one
about to tear itself, not i.

gone to weeds, still remembers the gray road
that set out to cross the desert of the future.
and how, always just ahead,
gray water glittered, happy to be just a mirage.
who steps off the gray bus at the depot?
sidewalks shudder all the way home.
blinds close their scratchy eyes.
who settles in your old room?
sniffy air sprawls as if it owns the place,
and now your teenage secrets have no one to tell.
for the spider laying claim to the corner, there is a stickiness to spin, that the living may beg
to be wrapped in silk and devoured,
leaving not even the flinch from memory.

<|startoftext|>i got a call from the white house, from the
president himself, asking me if i’d do him a personal
favor. i like the president, so i said, “sure, mr.
president, anything you like.” he said, “just act
like nothing’s going on. act normal. that would
mean the world to me. can you do that, leon?” “why,
sure, mr. president, you’ve got it. normal, that’s
how i’m going to act. i won’t let on, even if i’m
tortured,” i said, immediately regretting that “tortured”
bit. he thanked me several times and hung up. i was
dying to tell someone that the president himself called
me, but i knew i couldn’t. the sudden pressure to
act normal was killing me. and what was going on
anyway. i didn’t know anything was going on. i
saw the president on tv yesterday. he was shaking
hands with a farmer. what if it wasn’t really a
farmer? i needed to buy some milk, but suddenly
i was afraid to go out. i checked what i had on.
i looked “normal” to me, but maybe i looked more
like i was trying to be normal. that’s pretty
suspicious. i opened the door and looked around.
what was going on? there was a car parked in front
of my car that i had never seen before, a car that
was trying to look normal, but i wasn’t fooled.
if you need milk, you have to get milk, otherwise
people will think something’s going on. i got into
my car and sped down the road. i could feel those
little radar guns popping behind every tree and bush,
but, apparently, they were under orders not to stop
me. i ran into kirsten in the store. “hey, what’s
going on, leon?” she said. she had a very nice smile.
i hated to lie to her. “nothing’s going on. just
getting milk for my cat,” i said. “i didn’t know
you had a cat,” she said. “i meant to say coffee.
you’re right, i don’t have a cat. sometimes i
refer to my coffee as my cat. it’s just a private
joke. sorry,” i said. “are you all right?” she
asked. “nothing’s going on, kirsten. i promise
you. everything is normal. the president shook
hands with a farmer, a real farmer. is that such
a big deal?” i said. “i saw that,” she said, “and
that man was definitely not a farmer.” “yeah, i
know,” i said, feeling better.

the way warmth left the bosnian after he’d burned the last page of the last book,
knowing he had reached the end of something though it was not end enough.
of course kisses, the stages of kissing like running borders,
endless conversations, stations of the cross, till even the promise of kissing bores you,
of course teeth gnashing, ethnic cleansing. the cynical will shrug off the past,

a man climbs the hill to an amphitheater to play his cello at twilight
and history stops talking for a moment and sighs
while the melancholy of albinoni

the way passing a baby around a room can be sacramental,
and the memories of simple pleasures become more beautiful, the memory
of your joy on a highway to see in the next lane in a neighboring car
a clown take off his nose at the end of the day, the memory
of how your mother laid roses, sweetheart roses, on the cold grate of the fireplace,
and the sudden rain one afternoon in fall after you’d hiked far into the dells
and you huddled deep in your overcoat in the wet,
waiting out the storm with a sheep
that had come up to lean against your side

a deepness that could balance a small world of dirt as easily as a gift
of gleaming red tomatoes held out to you eight at a time.
if they ask you how it felt, say solitary,
at first the ease of sleeping alone, warm without even a sheet,
then the nonchalance of a dirt road leading down the hill, its dust
raised and re-raised in plumes as each guest departed,
and later, say it was like the blind cat that came out of nowhere
to lie on your tile floor, lifting its face to stare with white marble eyes.
if they ask what you heard, tell them the single note of the watchman,
who coughed his one syllable when you went to bed,
and at the end of every dream when you woke with a simple plea—stay, go—again, the cough of the watchman.
if they ask about thirst, tell them no one could carry water as far
as it had to go, so that when it was time to rest,
people went to the spigot at the edge of the train tracks
and cupped their hands under the water, lowering their faces to drink.
tell them a man could stand at noon in the park wearing nothing but underwear
and beg for hours with his cup empty.
tell them you could sit quietly while phrases you didn't know you knew 
rose up in the language there and on an undisturbed lake in your mind 
you could back float—that weightless prayer that prays let me die with my toes pointing up at the sun.
when they ask what people will eventually get around to asking, 
how was the food? tell them batata, mamón, guanábana, maní,
indigenous crops exchanging places with hunger,
giving up to the dark store window whose inventory is one hand
of bananas sold one banana at a time, giving up to little pyramids of limes
by the side of the road and the kids who tend them, dreaming
of a few coins tossed down in the dirt.

nothing can replace the sea breezes you were born to.
nothing can stay the shy ache in the palm
you hold out to the fortune-teller.

hunting still after your futures become all irises

what’s most human must drive
an arrow to the heart.
ghosts, too, must abide by this directive
& remain transparent,
going about their business in old houses.
before i was an i, i longed to be ethereal.
sprouting wings at will & gliding through
cul-de-sacs and malls around the valley.
my hands, too, would gradually disappear
followed by my arms, then neck & head
until my whole body was slight as allergen.
before i was an i, i spoke an old language
that would return on drowsy afternoons.
therefore i struggled to say
the simplest sentences. so much so
that the maligned semicolon
became an ardent ally, an island
of pause and the deep breath.the comma, too, bless its tiny soul,
was the crumb which the god
of small favors multiplied
tenfold for my morning pie.
before i was an i, knowledge
clung to me like burrs & hunger
guided my ship like the barefoot light

but this gang of birds is much too slick.
they are my homeys of the air
with their mousse-backed hair and crayola
black coats like small fry hoods who smoke
and joke about each other’s mothers,
virginal sisters, and the sweet arc of revenge.
these birds spurn my uneaten celery sticks,
feckless gestures, ineffective hosannas.
they tag one another, shrill and terrible,
caroling each to each my weekly wages.

but these, thy lovers are not dead.…they will rise up and hear your voice. . .. and run to kiss your mouth.
–the sphinx
in the garden of père lachaise,
city of the dead, we passed angels
covering their faces in shame,
& nineteenth-century trees, with tops bowed
as if their only purpose was to grieve,
& crossed the transversales to wilde’s grave.
when lovers leave, they leave their kisses
glistening on the gray slab,
on impressions of lips themselves,
a tissue of strangers’ cells
the conservators cannot leave alone,
& scrub the graffiti, as the plaque decrees
by law, no one can deface this tomb,
& still the images of lips remain,
dark gray stains of animal fat
imprisoned in limestone.
lips are pressed as high as lovers
climb, against the sphinx’s ridiculous
headdress, on the carved trumpet
of fame, & on the cheeks of its voracious face
of mindless passion flying with eyes pinched tight,
that some farsighted lover tried to open
with lines from a red pen, like a blepharoplasty,
while others kissed its sybaritic mouth
to make a poem a prophecy.
so here is love alive
surviving the wreckage it survives,
a lipstick envelope of hearts on their flight
to some other place, less aware,
more receiving, a final champ de grâce.

i will be sorry for everything

i speak to you as if you were my brother.
i will forgive everyone.
death will make this possible.
there will be no other.
death was in the mind
before thought or love,
in ourselves, and in our lovers.
the poem of death is speechless.
a companion will appear again
like another self, like your brother. enough now, enough has been said.
the spinning leaf will spin

now beyond disgrace, failure, winter streets,
or whatever attacks, and then retreats.
classrooms emptied of children’s things,
paper and paste, and love’s imaginings,
bundles of peace, christmas-blessed
with the unborn and the dead at rest,
nothing can reach you now, not lead or steel
or what life itself eventually reveals.

in hallways crowded with locked wheelchairs,
cradles of a century’s platitudes,
the stale air smelling of disinfectant
and weeping wounds enough to stupefy nurses,
among the staring insomniacs of the day room,
the stroke victims on their rented gurneys,
complaining orderlies and rattling carts
among these in this place my father lay
at the end of everything
in the curved landscapes of white sheets
abandoned finally by parents, his son,
the loyal company, old friends, his death
a sign of other deaths too soon to come
unable to recall one life, his thoughts,
features, he lay unknown to himself,
the tall hunter of pheasants out with his boy
in vellum corn and brassy orchards
in an autumn that never was, the proud
white-collared ford employee lay on a bed
too short for legs tattooed with red burn-rings
from daily syringes of cytosar
considered useless, still a requirement
for state funding for a body described
leukemic waiting for saturday's fiddlers
who came to raise the spirits of the dead
with a music he never cared for turned
suddenly attractive, he found genius,
theirs or his like some lyrical phosphor
that shapes itself in the dry night air
to make a thing then make it disappear
he lay listening to the county fiddlers
at the end of every purpose, act and form
i leave you here, my father, in perfect accord.

imagine half your face
rubbed out yet
you are suited up
and walking
to the office.
how will your mates
greet you?
with heavy hearts,
flowers,
rosary beads?
how shall we greet
the orphan boy,
the husband whose hand
slipped, children
and wife swept away?
how to greet
our new years
and our birthdays?
shall we always
light a candle?
do we remember
that time erases
the shore, grass
grows, pain’s
modified?
at hikkaduwa
in 1980 i wrote a ditty,
a sailor’s song
about rain
in sunny ceylon.
i don’t know
what calypsonians
would compose
about this monstrous
wave, this blind hatchet man;
don’t know
the baila singers’ reply;
we are a “happy and
go” people
yet the fisherman’s wife
knows
that her grandfather
was eaten by the ocean—
fisher communities
have suffered in time
and what’s happened
now is just another feast
for that bloody,
sleeping mother
lapping at our island;
but what if the ocean
were innocent,
the tectonic plates
innocent, what if god
were innocent?
i do not know
how to walk upon the beach,
how to lift corpse
after corpse
until i am exhausted,
how to stop the tears
when half my face
has been rubbed out
beyond
the railroad tracks
and this anaesthetic,
this calypso come
to the last verse.
what shall we write
in the sand?
where are gravestones
incinerated? whose
ashes are these urned
and floating through a house
throttled by water?
shall we build
a memorial
some calculated distance
from the sea, in a park,
in the shape of a giant wave
where we can write
the names of the dead?
has the wave lost
its beauty? is it now
considered obscene?
yet tomorrow
we must go to the ocean
and refresh ourselves
in the sea breeze
down in hikkaduwa
where it is raining
in sunny ceylon.
tomorrow, we must
renew our vows
at sunrise, at sunset.
let us say the next time
the ocean recedes
and parrots gawk
and flee, and restless
dogs insist their humans
wake up, we will not peer
at the revelation
of the ocean bed,
nor seek photographs.
we will run to higher ground,
and gathered there
with our children,
our cats, dogs,
pigs, with what we’ve
carried in our hands
—albums, letters—
we will make a circle,
kneel, sit,
stand in no particular
direction, pray and be silent,
open our lungs
and shout thanks
to our gods
thanks to our dogs.

jesus did not ride that monstrous wave,
not yahweh, jah, allah, none of the major
gods or the minor ones, not even the godless
strode that bugger which sliced our lives
in two: the past where we danced ballroom
while the children played carom, and mangos
stained our lapels, and today, hobbling,
scavenging in ash heaps, how easy
the arithmetic, day and night, two by two.
bring on the mind workers.
let a thousand doctors bloom.
i lived right here on the x, my name
is blue: sea green blue blue green
i do not speak in tongues. i am not
disordered, a babbler. i did not lose
anybody close to me, just 30,000
fellow island bees, not to worry, machan,
old fellow, i will subscribe tomorrow,
the order of every day, skip and jump rope,
whistle, talk to aid workers, even swim.

the elephants of reckoning
are bunches of scruff
men and women picking up
thrown out antennae
from the rubbish
bins of the city
to fix on their tubular
bells and horn about
by oil can fires
in the freezing midnight
of the old new year
we ride by their music
every hour in cabs on trains
hearing the pit pat
of our grown-wise pulse
shut in shut out
from the animals
of the dry season
the losers and boozers,
we must not admit our eyes
into the courtyard
the whimsy of chance
and our other excuses—
dollars in pocket—
to write beautiful songs
is all i ask, god
to do right with friends
and love a woman
and live to eighty
have people listen
to the story of my trip to america
the elephants of reckoning
are beaten and hungry
and walk their solitary horrors
out every sunrise slurping
coffee bought with change
while in some houses
freedom-bound lovers
embrace late and read tagore
about the people working
underneath the falling of empires.

the king cobra slides
through our jungles,

by the riverbanks

on galle face green, or ride
horse carts in the jaffna peninsula
of your ancestors, or bear a child
in colombo general hospital,
or sleep in cinnamon gardens
under a mango tree,
or beg in the borella market,
or ride for historical reasons
on patrol boats in the bay,
or stilt-fish off matara down south,
just remember here everywhere
there is only man burning
and woman burning
here everywhere
in shallow graves
in deep graves
floating out of salt water
washing down the sands
the dead have tongues
the dead have ears
tongues are speaking to ears
what are they saying?
what are they saying?
tell us, brown bear
bolting out of your cave.
tell us, leopard
leaning on your branch.
tell us, flamingos.
bend your necks
and pour wine pour wine
hoopoes, kingfishers,

kissing your lips
i try to forget roses
or the fruit of palmyra trees
sweet and strong
tongue lolling upon tongue
heart beating
against heart beating,
these are my words
signifying our human bodies
which poetry does not capture,
the absolute desire i have
to kiss your lips
on this hot and sunny afternoon.
i do not know how much longer
i can walk about the garden
kissing roses, or perambulate the toddy tavern of my dreams
where black faces and white toddy mix
in black and white memories
of jaffna, sri lanka,
my tamil countrymen
far away on an island across the sea.
far away and far away
the palmyra fruit and your lips.
to drink toddy now.
to kiss your rosy lips now.
to uproot the roses in my garden
and offer them upon my tongue now.
to fly to sri lanka
and grab the last fruit on the tree
before history throws the tamils into the sea
as is said it will do;
before all this and everything else,
before the apocalypse,
i do so sincerely wish,
though my words may not fit,
to rest my head in your hair
and kiss your lips.

in florida a giant hamster lays in bed worrying about its future
the hamster has bad eyesight
and many other problems
later that night the hamster drives its car around
listening to sad music; the master lightly drums its paws on the steering wheel
the hamster is alone
but not for long: at home three waffle friends wait
cooling inside a countertop oven in the kitchen
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
in the evening the hamster sits at the computer
watermelon juice and coffee sit by the computer
the hamster drinks all of the coffee
after a few minutes the hamster drinks all of the watermelon juice
the hamster lays its paw atop a neatly folded to-do list; this is a resourceful hamster
with a strong will, a sincere and loving hamster friend, and a confident nature
we do not need to spend any more time or empathy on this hamster

notice how my forehead approaches you at a high speed
notice the contortions on my face; hear and feel the impact
of my forehead against your eyebrow
never get angry if someone doesn’t do things for you
react to disappointment by being quiet and nice
and alone, not by being confrontational or frustrated
in 1952 a dsm copy-editor removed ‘headbutting’
from the entry for ‘psychopathic behavior’
thereafter the headbutt has thrived
across all social, political, and elementary school gym classes
today the headbutt is a sign of friendship, stability, and inner calm
the exponential effect of your repeated lies makes me afraid what will happen
to us; ‘the perfect headbutt’ destroys both participants and impresses
even the severely disillusioned, and the phrase ‘giant poem’ reverberates
through my head with the austerity of ancient ruins, the off-centered beauty
of repressed veganism, and the lord of the rings trilogy
i forgot what this poem was about
<|endoftext|>

the first story i ever write
is a bright crayon picture
of a dancing tree, the branches
tossed by island wind.
i draw myself standing beside the tree,
with a colorful parrot soaring above me,
and a magical turtle clasped in my hand,
and two yellow wings fluttering
on the proud shoulders of my ruffled
cuban rumba dancer's
fancy dress.
in my california kindergarten class,
the teacher scolds me: real trees
don't look like that.
it's the moment
when i first
begin to learn
that teachers
can be wrong.
they have never seen
the dancing plants
of cuba.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>two sets
of family stories,
one long and detailed,
about many centuries
of island ancestors, all living
on the same tropical farm...
the other side of the family tells stories
that are brief and vague, about violence
in the ukraine, which dad's parents
had to flee forever, leaving all their
loved ones
behind.
they don't even know if anyone
survived.
when mami tells her flowery tales of cuba,
she fills the twining words with relatives.
but when i ask my
ukrainian-jewish-american grandma
about her childhood in a village
near snowy kiev,
all she reveals is a single
memory
of ice-skating
on a frozen pond.
apparently, the length
of a grown-up's
growing-up story
is determined
by the difference
between immigration
and escape.

mad has decided to catch a vulture,
the biggest bird she can find.
she is so determined, and so inventive,
that by stringing together a rickety trap
of ropes and sticks, she creates
a puzzling structure that just might
be clever enough to trick a buzzard,
once the trap’s baited with leftover pork
from supper.
mad and i used to do everything together,
but now i need a project all my own,
so i roam the green fields,
finding bones.
the skull of a wild boar.
the jawbone of a mule.
older cousins show me
how to shake the mule’s quijada,
to make the blunt teeth
rattle.
guitars.
drums.
gourds.
sticks.
a cow bell.
a washboard.
pretty soon, we have
a whole orchestra.
on cuban farms, even death
can turn into
music.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
newsmen call it the cuban missile crisis.
teachers say it's the end of the world.
at school, they instruct us to look up
and watch the cuban-cursed sky.
search for a streak of light.
listen for a piercing shriek,
the whistle that will warn us
as poisonous a-bombs
zoom close.
hide under a desk.
pretend that furniture is enough
to protect us against perilous flames.
radiation. contamination. toxic breath.
each air-raid drill is sheer terror,
but some of the city kids giggle.
they don't believe that death
is real.
they've never touched a bullet,
or seen a vulture, or made music
by shaking
the jawbone
of a mule.
when i hide under my frail school desk,
my heart grows as rough and brittle
as the slab of wood
that fails to protect me
from reality's
gloom.

i have come to realize the body is its own pyre, that degree
rises from within, the fatty acids a kind of kindling.
like a scientist in a lab, this much i have established, blood jelled
like gasoline, the years spread before me like a map
pinned with targets, where i’m raging even now.
it works both ways. clear the forests to see your enemies
and your enemies see you clearly. like all effective incendiaries,
i won’t only bloom where i’m planted.

tonight we will function like women.
the snow has gone away, the ice with its amniotic glare.
i clasp my sister’s tiny hand.
we will not turn away
though spring, spring with its black appetite,
comes seeping out of the earth.
the lion was sad. he suffered us
to touch him. when i placed the bread of my hands
in his mammalian heat, i was reminded
that the world outside this world
is all vinegar and gall, that to be a young girl at the foot of a god
requires patience. timing.
the white witch has mustered her partisans.
because i am fascinated by her bracelets strung with baby teeth,
i will remember her as the woman
who grins with her wrists. from my thicket of heather
i note that in her own congenital way
she is pure, that tonight she ushers something new into the world.
i cannot stop it. i cannot stop it just as in that other place
i could not keep the planes with their spiked fires from coming.
though in this closed realm the smell of camphor is overwhelming
i have nothing but my hands to use
in ministering to the dead. here too
my hands must suffice.
hush now while i testify. they are shaving him.
the corona of his mane falls away
like pieces of money. in the moon’s milk light
her bangled wrists grin as she raises the blade.
something is diffused. in whatever world he comes again
there will be women like us who choose to.

somebody says draw a map. populate it with the incidents
of your childhood. mark the spot where the lake receded
after a winter of light snow. the stairs on which someone
slapped you. the place where the family dog hung itself
by jumping over the back fence while still on the dog run,
hours later its body like a limp flag on a windless day.
draw a map, someone says. let yourself remember.
in the refugee camp a hundred thousand strong
draw the stony outcrop from which you could no longer see
the plume of smoke that was your village. draw a square
for the bathroom stall where grandpa hid each day
in order to eat his one egg free from the starving eyes
of his classmates, an x for the courthouse where you and he
were naturalized, a broken line for the journey. draw a map,
jon says. let it be your way into the poem. here is where
that plane filled with babies crashed that i was not on.
here is where i was ashamed. on the second floor
at pranash university the people wait their turn. have you
drawn your map, jon asks. he has rolled up his sleeves.
forty-five minutes to noon the prince stands up and says
that the monks must be excused. we watch them file out,
saffron robes as if their bodies have burst into blossom.
draw a map. fly halfway around the globe. here is the room
next to the library where you realize how poor your tradition is,
the local people with poetic forms still in use that date back
to the time of christ. tell us about your map. explain
how these wavy lines represent the river, this rectangle
the school-turned-prison where only seven
escaped with their lives. this is my map. this star the place
where i sat in a roomful of people among whom not one
was not touched by genocide. every last map resplendent with death
though nobody knows where their loved ones lie buried.
how many times can i appropriate a story that is not mine to tell?
the woman stands up and says she is not a poet, that she
doesn’t have the words. she points to a triangle on a piece of paper.
here is the spot where she found human bones in the well
of her childhood home, and how her mother told her don’t be afraid because it was not the work of wild animals.

listen closely as i sing this. the man standing at the gate
tottering on his remaining limb is a kind of metronome, his one
leg planted firmly on the earth. yes, i have made him beautiful
because i aim to lay all my cards on the table. in the book review
the critic writes, “barry seeks not to judge but to understand.”
did she want us to let her be, or does she want
to be there walking the grounds of the old prison on the hill
of the poison tree where comparatively a paltry twenty thousand
died? in the first room with the blown up
black-and-white of a human body gone abstract someone has
to turn and face the wall not because of the human pain
represented in the photo but because of her calmness,
the tranquility with which she tells us that her father
and her sister and her brother were killed. in graduate school
a whole workshop devoted to an image of a woman with bleach
thrown in the face and the question of whether or not
the author could write, “the full moon sat in the window
like a calcified eye, the woman’s face aglow with a knowingness.”
i felt it come over me and i couldn’t stop. i tried to pull myself
together and i couldn’t. they were children. an army of child
soldiers. in the room papered with photos of the khmer rouge
picture after picture of teenagers, children whose parents
were killed so that they would be left alone in the world
to do the grisly work that precedes paradise.
and the photos of the victims, the woman holding her newborn
in her arms as her head is positioned in a vise, in this case
the vise an instrument not of torture but of documentation, the head held still as the camera captures
the image, the thing linking all their faces, the abject fear
and total hopelessness as exists
in only a handful of places in the history of the visible world.
for three $us per person she will guide you through what was
tuol sleng prison, hill of the strychnine tree.
without any affectation she will tell you the story of how
her father and her sister and her brother went among
the two million dead. there are seventy-four forms
of poetry in this country and each one is still meant to be sung.

say, when we woke those icy spring mornings they were still there.
the upper portion of their faces long ruined but you could still see
the meaning in their hands,
palms once covered in gold. we knew better than to call them
by their names, light that shines throughout the universe
and his consort, but there were stories
of travelers lost in the foothills of the hindu kush and a distant
brilliance that led them home. the way a candle physically enters
your body after it has been
snuffed out. the pearly smoke suffused in the air. in one school
hundreds of miles away all the
girls my age were poisoned,
and last week outside the capital
a woman like my sister was shot dead in front of a crowd by two men
who forced their bodies into her body and then judged her an infidel
so they could kill her and be done with it. after the visitors were blasted i had a dream.
i saw a human man standing by a lake and no one was looking at him
directly. his image
on the surface of the water cleaner than anything in this world.
in my
dream the man
said, “thousands
of lifetimes ago
when my body was cut
into pieces by an evil king, i was not caught up in the idea of the self.”
then in my
dream someone
picked up a rock and i woke up.
it took almost a month,
the great heads drilled with holes, then anti-aircraft tanks rolled in.
each hundred-foot niche now empty but each cavity left shaped like us,
like a person. before it happened
we talked about it. grandfather said don’t they have a share in heaven?
second aunt said it was more realistic this way. god not in heaven
but in exile.

tucked
up
safe
in
the
leeward
side
under
the
heart
because
sometimes
our
god
is
a jealous god,
the evil
eye
lidless

all-seeing. instead we will wait until it is done,
until the creature has been cleaned and wrapped in soft cloth,
the
bloody
cord
that
binds
you
severed.
and
maybe
you
will
name
it
dolores,
which

grief,
or perhaps you will call it mara, the hebrew name for bitterness
because
this
is
how
we
protect
what
we
love,
by
hiding
what it
truly means to
us, the little bag of gold
we
keep
buried
in the yard,
the thing we will do anything
to
keep
safe,
even
going
so
far
as
to
pretend
it
doesn’t
exist,
that
there’s
nothing massing in the dark
despite the steady light emanating from your face, a radiance
so bright sometimes i can’t look at you, the joy so overpowering
you
want
to
shout
it
from
the
highest
mountaintop
straight into god’s ear.

one day we will all be like this—the boat’s sickening pitch, & the delicateness
needless, consumable.
how everything here naturally passes into night, a room
w/o walls.
could mindlessness keep us alive? could bright colors?
tonight i am thinking of the young woman who dreams of her father
being shot in the head. imagine needing to believe the one you love
has been destroyed.
now it is after midnight—the spindrift lunar & diaphanous. here alone on deck
could i make peace w/it all in thirty seconds—the water’s inherent rising, the gasping
for air?
i have never seen such omnipresence, such vast dreamlessness— 
but i too am such things.
what does it mean to be eroded? what would be the significance of slipping one leg
over the rail & straddling the indifference?
yes. once upon a time we spent three days on a boat out of kobé, japan.
all night the waves. all night the somnambulistic urges.
or how as children we would swim in a hard rain—the lake’s surface ragged & torn,
but underneath
the roots of the water lilies like ladders
trailing down into the marvelous.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
shagged-gold, at rest the great haunches
as if axled, fur sleeked like a butter rug.
in the serengeti sun, the male’s harem
like a solar system, each lady kept
exclusive, her seasonal heat for him alone,
estrous belly pressed to the ground,
then the male’s riding her musculature—
throughout evolution the cat’s barbed penis
nicking his breached mate as he dismounts.
see the deliberate walk, cool as a criminal,
the multi-jointed forepaws placed consciously
even by the usurped king, his eye teeth blacked,
his tail rotted off, tired wag of a bloody stump
as he finally falls dying, the crucified face bedded
in its wheel of hair, the tawny miscegenated eyes
binocular in breadth. shark in the long grasses.
shark in the long grass. smell everywhere, the gazelle
with its small-headed splendor gracing the plains
is ambushed, devoured, its horned bone rack
souvenired, the murderer’s ripping muzzle crimsoned.
in the despot’s sons’ palace of pure gold
the three in the iron cage lazing like statues.
when the american unlocks the hinged door
our shackled hearts contract. unhooded and naked
we are pushed into their presence,
and for a shining moment the animals study us,
these fabulous aliens.
here in a desert captivity
snatched from the baobab’s sour fruit,
their swagged bellies shifted, broken, and resignedly
the ancient drive rose up only in one—
its head wreathed beyond sorrow
as it slouched out of the habitual darkness,
the permanent rictus of its terrible mouth
pain-struck. the thing came toward me
with its ruined light, and i saw affliction in it.
dream of mastery. dream of being wholly consumed,
freed. i am the lion and the lion is me.
then the american pulls us out.
<|endoftext|>

 literally the thing has been gutted, a ragged gash
carved under its tail to midway up its chest, eyes
like stagnant water, horns intricate as a woodwind.
where did the viscera go? where do the viscera ever go?
i am in a car driving to the northernmost point
on this spit. porte de mort. death’s northern door.
literally where my grandmother lives. her 89-year-old cousin
has just fallen out a window but is all right, the bruises
like stained glass. enthusiasm. to be in god.
my grandmother says it is proof, and i nod my head
because i too would like to live in such a world
where an eighty-nine year old crawls out a window
and falls seven feet to the ground, in turn the miracle
of her body stained a deep blue, vitreous. in one room
of the unfinished mansion where we will celebrate the day,
the ninety-year-old matriarch sleeps in her four-poster bed
under the canopy of a wedding dress, its hundred eyelets
a fallacy. after dinner someone will hand around an indulgence
of the black madonna of częstochowa, the lady’s dark cheek
marred as if she has been scratched. who at this table
fled the police? who left that place in flames, the rubble
of infinite hearths? the deer’s eyes like perfect cataracts,
the evidence cooling. when i think of my room in the earth,
i can’t breathe. a friend of a friend recently hit a small bear
with his car. at the end of my favorite novel a bear
is dancing on a makeshift stage, the bear a grotesquerie
like the rest of us. no one stopped to help,
said my friend. traffic barely slowed. i do not judge this,
or even the surreptitious footage of the workers
somewhere on the killing floor, stomping
the breast-heavy creatures with their rubber boots.
how we raise them not to fly, what should waft
gnostically through the air, the hollowness of evolving.
my heart is doing that thing again, saying climb the stairs
on your knees. i tell a friend a man halfway across the world
has been killed, torn apart by motorbikes, each limb
tied in a different direction. could a universe be born this way?
one minute you are scarping the silvery bark off a birch
when it comes to you forever and there you lie
in the bed of a blood-smeared truck at a stoplight
on highway 41 because this is the season of messages.
the man was a teacher. he taught girls.
when they came for him he told his children
not to cry. then the men took out half his bowel,
the viscera steaming as they do, and they tied him
ingeniously in such a way that they tore him apart.
in that other place three million of us died. when i left,
i left them all behind. in the unfinished mansion
someone will ask me what i’m thankful for.
what to say? that one of the most beautiful things
i have ever seen was a paper nest secreted by wasps,
and that in the summer i would sleep under it,
the runnelled mass turning like a planet in the moonlight?
i will admit i was in favor of war and now look what’s happened.
at the end of the road the man driving the truck will eat
the deer. if i had to watch someone be torn apart by motorbikes
i would still be me, which is the horror of it all.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
i am ten.
my mother sits in a black
rocking chair in the parlor
and tells stories of a country school
surrounded by ricefields
and no roads.
i stand in the kerosene light
behind her,
earning my allowance.
a penny
for each white hair i pull.

the emotion of trucks, buses & troop trains
brings them here,
to the wrong side of another state.
a woman at the klamath falls depot
calls it the wrong side of the ocean.

crumbs hide around the table legs
in the mess hall,
dishes & silverware
clink a strange song.
families talk across long tables.
questions drop like puzzles
to the unfinished floor.
3
blocks away from their new home
a woman finds a latrine
not backed up. stands
in line, waiting her turn
in the wind. down
the center of the open room:
12 toilet stools, six pair,
back to back. sits down
and asks for privacy,
holding a towel in front of her
with trembling hands.
4
in a north dakota prisoner-of-war camp,
surrounded by germans & italians,
a quiet man
hammers a samurai sword from scrap metal
at night in a boiler room.
a secret edge
to hold against the dark mornings.
he sends love notes to his pregnant wife
in tule lake
sewn in pants
mailed home for mending.
his censored letters
mention a torn pocket.
she finds the paper near the rip,
folded & secret in the lining.
white voices
claim the other side of the ocean
is so crowded
the people want to find death
across the phantom river.
headlines shake their nervous words.
out on the coast
beach birds print their calligraphy
in the sand.
it is such a small country.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
it is the picture of a man who dreams
at night, his dreams a cartoon color
he can’t forget in his blue cell:
a fork chases a hard-boiled egg
across the smooth paper,
cheered on by an angry alarm clock.
the clock rings
and the artist knows it is morning
even though the iron cell
is in a basement with no windows.
in the center of the painting
the devil blows a whistle
and his pitchfork drips blood.
above in the night
a man has taken off in a buck rogers spaceship
heading for a yellow one-eyed moon.
he grips the steering wheel in the open cockpit
and doesn’t look back.
in a lower corner
under a naked tree
a satyr sits and plays his pan-flute.
the notes weave all around the painting,
twist around a girl
dancing in veils.
the man who dreams all this
pulls at his covers,
drowses at the bottom of the painting.
the man who painted this
died in his dreams.

—after frank o’hara
you have been smiling across the table at your date
with a sesame seed stuck in your teeth.
you will gain sophistication, become accepted by reader’s digest, and retire in puyallup.
in your next life you will be a teacher
and no one will ever call you by your first name.
after your next vacation you will come home
and discover that your neighbors have redecorated
in the style of iowa trailer court.
if you feel like you’re getting old,
secretly plant zucchini in your neighbor’s flowerbeds.
avoid people who iron their sheets
or roll their socks & underwear.
painting and poetry and music will show us where we should
be going, not the senate or tv news.
the next thermos bottle you see will actually
be a listening device made in korea.
all the people in this restaurant
are glad that they are not you.

the sky wants the water to turn grey,
but if i notice how waves
play with the clumps of yellow flags,
or the way turtles share logs,
or even try to understand a friend’s decision
to walk onto a glacier
and end her life—i will be ready
for any poems that have been waiting.
the horizon opens as i walk,
escorted by swans and canada geese.
i need to stop backpedaling into the present.
in my old life people would straighten
the truth, but the river
flows in curves.
the names of my father and my mother
rest next to each other in greenwood cemetery.
the distance between me and the mountains
measures an uneven thought: i feel like an orphan.
an early moon is just a piece of change
in the softening sky.
light is such an actress. time to seek
hopper’s wish to simply paint sunlight
on the wooden wall of a house. i am growing
older. maru in japanese means

no, i am not deformed.
i wear these socks
because i haven't any gloves,
and my fingers are bitten with frost.
they feel like stumps.
luckily, i finished covering
the citrus tree with sheets of burlap.
before darkness,
i will light a smudge pot
near the mummified trunk,
then anoint my hands in a blue salve.
yesterday was cold
but the freeze is on now.
i must remind myself
not to lick any cars.
mr. nishizawa, a house over,
told me his nephew
lost a fourth of his tongue
for that reason. years ago,
the rosebushes were ruined to a freeze
and have never come back.
if needed, i will stay up all night
and pray, will let the hoarfrost
burn in my chest. my grandfather
ate the yield from this tree
after he died. i saw him.

that boy, the champion breath holder,
kenji takezo, lost his title
this year to mack stanton
a retired truck driver
new to the area.
held in the town swimming pool
thirty-five participants inhaled
deeply all at once
submerged the depth.
the contest went on into twilight.
one by one each person
came up sucking air.
kenji was the town favorite.
we wanted him to win again.
he trained so hard,
it was the only real talent
he had
other than surfing and making
trouble. when he surfaced
second to last
gulping the night
then vomiting water,
we were disappointed.
he was doing so well.
he had his lucky twenty-pound brick
cradled in his lap.
it kept him down.
but that trucker mack was too good.
he read
comic books, aloud, underwater.
we watched from the bleachers
his laughter bursting above him.
kenji saw this too.
he never had anybody
read to him
not even his mother,
and he wanted to hear
what was being read
what his opponent found so funny.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
 after kenji takezo fell from a wave,
the turbulence of whitewash confused
his sense of direction.
he breathed in
when he should have
held tight. by accident, he swallowed
the pacific. the water poured down his throat,
a blue cascade he could not see.
he felt in his stomach
the heavy life of the ocean.
it wasn’t funny, but he giggled
when a school of fish tickled his ribs.
he went home, the surf not rideable,
it was no longer there,
the water weighted in his belly.
that night, while he slept, the tide moved.
the long arms of the moon
reached inside him pulling the pacific free.
when he woke the next morning,
he lay in a puddle of ocean that was his.

steel horses nodding
in the petroleum field are beasts
that suck
the crude of earth.
they have lived here for as long as i
remember. this moment,
i smell wild incense:
heather, abducted by a desert wind.
its growth hides
the rain-carved ribs of the foothills.
evening swallows
the city fasting on late fall.
years ago, after hearing the story
about a boy who lost
both legs while playing on an oil pump,
i was dared to straddle one.
all my friends were there to watch
the pacific behind me burning with dusk.
the brute lifted me to the sky,
where i merged with the twilight,
a warm breeze embracing my back.
none of them noticed
the world stopped to breathe.
when i looked, they disappeared.
nearby in pink-flowered bushes
someone found
the girl who’d been missing for weeks.
they stood in awe, the body
decomposing, while i rode
the slow bucking animal.
two months later, off the same pump,
a man dove,
an imperfect swan into night.
he landed in the dirt gully
breaking the soft, white wings
he never had.
today, i catch in my hand
an insect charged with lightning.
it tickles
the obscure scoop of my palm
as i hold it to my mouth and explain
a wish so simple
by morning i will have forgotten it.
i release
the bug to a desert wind
that is racing toward the sea,
a brutal dryness in its wake.
fire in the hills everywhere.
<|endoftext|>

about the only thing i thought i knew
was that nothing i’d ever know would do
any good. sunrise, say, or that the part
of the horse’s hoof that most resembles
a human palm is called the frog;
certain chords on the guitar of no mercantile use;
the abstruse circuitry of an envelope
quatrain; even the meaning of horripilation.
sometimes on a flatland mound the ancients had made,
i took heart in the pointlessness of stars
and lay there until my teeth chattered.
i earned my last boy scout merit badge
building a birdhouse out of license plates
manufactured by felons in the big house.
no more paramilitary organizations for me,
i said, ten years before i was drafted.
i had skills. sure-footedness and slick
fielding. eventually i would learn to unhook
a bra one-handed, practicing on my friend,
his sister's worn over his t-shirt (i took
my turns too). one easter sunday i hid
through the church service among the pipes
of the organ and still did not have faith,
although my ears rang until monday.
i began to know that little worth knowing
was knowable and faith was delusion.
i began to believe i believed in believing
nothing i was supposed to believe in,
except the stars, which, like me,
were not significant, except for their light,
meaning i loved them for their pointlessness.
i believed i owned them somehow.
a c major 7th chord was beautiful and almost rare.
the horse i loved foundered and had to be
put down. the middle rhyme in an envelope
quatrain was not imprisoned if it was right.
in cold air a nipple horripilates
and rises, the sun comes up and up and up,
a star that bakes the eggs
in a boy scout license plate birdhouse.
god was in music and music was god.
a drill sergeant seized me by my dog tag
chain and threatened to beat me
to a pile of bloody guts for the peace sign
i’d chiseled in the first of my two tags,
the one he said they’d leave in my mouth
before they zipped the body bag closed.
yet one more thing i’d come to know.
he also said that uncle sam owned my ass,
no more true than my ownership
of the stars. i can play a c major 7th chord
in five or six places on the neck of a guitar.
a stabled horse’s frog degrades; a wild horse’s
becomes a callus, smooth as leather.
stars are invisible in rainy weather,
something any fool knows, of course.

the first space shuttle launch got delayed until
sunday, so we had to watch the shuttle’s return
to earth in class instead—ps113’s paunchy black
& white rolled in, the antennae on top adjusted
sideways & down for better reception. that same
day, garrett stole my new pencil box. that same
day, cynthia peed her jeans instead of going
to the bathroom & letting garrett steal her pencil
box. both of us too upset to answer questions about
space flight, so we got sent to the back of the class.
i smelled like the kind of shame that starts a fight
on a tuesday afternoon. cynthia smelled like pee
& everyday jordache. the shuttle made its slick way
back to earth, peeling clouds from the monochromatic
sky & we all—even the astronomically marginal—
were winners. american, because a few days before,
a failed songwriter put a bullet in the president
in the name of jodie foster. the shuttle looked
like a bullet, only with wings & a cockpit, & when
it finally landed, the class broke into applause
& the teacher snatched a thinning american flag
from the corner, waved it back & forth in honor
of our wounded president & those astronauts.

blacks painted onto bricks & split vinyl on the east side,
jaws as tight as window locks with the curtains drawn
& behind that diligent fabric: blacks already tucked
into homemade forts—folding chairs, wobbly backbones
& the whole, snowy world waiting outside like ghost
stories whispered around the last sputtering match. & later,
top sheets pulled up over heads from fear of mirrors
at midnight or some backfired beater’s rusty pop pop pop
after the key twists at the edge of the week. no doubt:
tuesday is the scariest day in section 8, but friday is right
after it in the suburbs. & after those trembling weekdays,
even more blacks with money disappearing & reappearing
as unexpectedly as poltergeists inside of tvs & haunted
trees with fast fingers in west side yards. & still not
a wavelength of any kind for a black to put in the bank.
the inks in everybody’s hatted & contracting checkbooks
don’t change black. some front-row architecture might.
some guns, too, & their loud, colorful opportunities:
whatever version of black is inside a fist around a grip.
not a color, really—more like the face a man makes in
the glinting face of a gun pointed at him every single day.

with big afros like it’s 1981 peeing into

before officer friendly hit his lights. face the car, fingers locked behind
your heads. right after the fireworks
started popping off. do i need to call 
the drug dog? right after the rattling
windows, mosquitoes as busy in my ears
as 4th of july traffic cops. right before
the thrill of real planets & pretend planets
spun high into the sky, ra throwing up
three west side fingers, each ringed
by pyrotechnic glory & the misnomer
of the three of us grinning at the cop’s club
down swinging at almost the exact same
time pryor says, cops put a hurting on your
ass, man. & fireworks light up in the same
colors as angry knuckles if you don’t
duck on the double. especially on the west
side—more carnivorous than almost any
other part of earth voyager saw when
it snapped a blue picture on its way out

 leaves scarcely breathing

the flickering swallow
draws circles in the dusk.
in my loving
dying heart
a twilight is coming,
a last ray, gently reproaching.
and over the evening forest
the bronze moon climbs to its place.
why has the music stopped?
why is there such silence?
<|endoftext|>

rain-mumble on the roof—
that’s the fire in black silk.
but even at the bottom of the sea

let us praise the twilight of freedom, brothers,
the great year of twilight!
a thick forest of nets has been let down
into the seething waters of night.
o sun, judge, people, desolate
are the years into which you are rising!
let us praise the momentous burden
that the people’s leader assumes, in tears.
let us praise the twilight burden of power,
its weight too great to be borne.
time, whoever has a heart
will hear your ship going down.
we have roped swallows together
into legions.
now we can’t see the sun.
everywhere nature twitters as it moves.
in the deepening twilight the earth swims into the nets
and the sun can’t be seen.
but what can we lose if we try one
groaning, wide, ungainly sweep of the rudder?
the earth swims. courage,
brothers, as the cleft sea falls back from our plow.
even as we freeze in lethe we’ll remember
the ten heavens the earth cost us.

mumbling predictions,
mouth dry with jealousy.
parched tongue

i’m not jealous any more
but i want you.
i carry myself like a victim
to the hangman.
i will not call you
either joy or love.
all my own blood is gone.
something strange paces there now.
another moment
and i will tell you:
it's not joy but torture
you give me.
i'm drawn to you
as to a crime—
to your ragged mouth,
to the soft bitten cherry.
come back to me,
i'm frightened without you.
never had you such power
over me as now.
everything i desire
appears to me.
i'm not jealous any more.

 whoever kisses time’s ancient nodding head
will remember later, like a loving son,
how the old man lay down to sleep
in the drift of wheat outside the window.
he who has opened the eyes of the age,
two large sleepy apples with inflamed lids,
hears forever after the roar of rivers
swollen with the wasted, lying times.
the age is a despot with two sleepy apples
to see with, and a splendid mouth of earth.
when he dies he’ll sink onto the numb
arm of his son, who’s already senile.
i know the breath growing weaker by the day
not long not till the simple song
of the wrongs of earth is cut off,
and a tin seal put on the lips.
o life of earth! o dying age!
i’m afraid no one will understand you
but the man with the helpless smile
of one who has lost himself.
o the pain of peeling back the raw eyelids
to look for a lost word, and with lime
slaking in the veins, to hunt
for night herbs for a tribe of strangers!
the age. in the sick son’s blood the deposit of lime
is hardening. moscow’s sleeping like a wooden coffin.
there’s no escaping the tyrant century.
after all these years the snow still smells of apples.
i want to run away from my own doorstep,
but where? out in the street it’s dark,
and my conscience glitters ahead of me
like salt strewn on the pavement.
somehow i’ve got myself set for a short journey
through the back lanes, past thatched eaves, starling houses,
an everyday passer-by, in a flimsy coat,
forever trying to button the lap-robe.
street after street flashes past,
the frozen runners crunch like apples;
can’t get the button through the button-hole,
it keeps slipping out of my fingers.
the winter night thunders
like iron hardware through the moscow streets.
knocks like a frozen fish, or billows in steam,
flashing like a carp in a rosy tea-room.
moscow is moscow again. i say hello to her.
‘don’t be stern with me; never mind.
i still respect the brotherhood
of the deep frost, and the pike’s justice.’
the pharmacy’s raspberry globe shines onto the snow.
somewhere an underwood typewriter’s rattled.
the sleigh-driver’s back, the snow knee-deep,
what more do you want? they won't touch you, won’t kill you.
beautiful winter, and the goat sky
has crumbled into stars and is burning with milk.
and the lap-robe flaps and rings
like horse-hair against the frozen runners.
and the lanes smoked like kerosene stoves,
swallowed snow, raspberry, ice,
endlessly peeling, like a soviet sonatina,
recalling nineteen-twenty.
the frost is smelling of apples again.
could i ever betray to gossip-mongers
the great vow to the fourth estate
and oaths solemn enough for tears?
who else will you kill? who else will you worship?
what other lie will you dream up?
there’s the underwood’s cartilage. hurry, rip out a key,
you’ll find a little bone of a pike.
and in the sick son’s blood the deposit of lime
will melt, and there’ll be sudden blessèd laughter.
but the simple sonatina of typewriters
is only a faint shade of those great sonatas.
<|endoftext|>

our lives no longer feel ground under them.
at ten paces you can’t hear our words.
but whenever there’s a snatch of talk
it turns to the kremlin mountaineer,
the ten thick worms his fingers,
his words like measures of weight,
the huge laughing cockroaches on his top lip,
the glitter of his boot-rims.
ringed with a scum of chicken-necked bosses
he toys with the tributes of half-men.

many months have passed
since the diagnosis,
and you’re still grieving for her.
she’s not dead yet.
but she’s lost, like a child is lost—
her mind the ocean floor,
where she kicks up sand
and churns in the water.
al, we call it, or ad—
never by its real name
as if mentioning the word would bring bad luck—
the need to cross one’s self across the heart,
throw back to the ocean half of one’s catch,
turn three times and pray to the east.
papa’s and her letters,
written during their courtship,
are tied with a faded, red ribbon
and sunk in a safe deposit box at bishop trust.
long ago, she gave them to you
for safekeeping. at the time
she exacted a promise from you,
that you would not read them
until she was dead.
we twist down the spiral staircase
curled like a strand of seaweed
into the cold room of vaults,
the heavy thud of door distinct as your sadness
following us everywhere. there,
you turn over the bundle of letters
in your hand like unbelievable money.
“i’m so tempted to read them,” you say.
you want her back,
the feisty and independent one,
the one who could, at eighty,
do ten knee bends in aerobics class,
dance a smooth jitterbug
and shuttle like the tide
to and from the house about her business.
not this elizabeth you mourn,
the one who can no longer reason,
who points and giggles at fat people
and smells, sometimes, like the ocean.
time slides like dali’s clock.
elizabeth is surprised
that she once was married and had a husband,
that she once gave birth to sons.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
in her illness
elizabeth believes we do this deliberately,
the washing of her body.
she blames me,
her japanese daughter-in-law
for having made keeping her clean a fetish.
angry, she says we do this to torment
her soul, the shower a hot
spray of needles we subject
on her moon-colored skin.
she hates it even more
if i’m there to wash her.
she wants her son,
the person she thinks of these days
as her lover, or husband, or father.
memory and privacy,
she cries at their loss
as i soap her down like an old car.
what protestations!
and as i listen to her,
i think of these bodies
we have given so freely to men,
yet feel ashamed of
when in the eyes of another woman.
how she fawns
when she thinks a man’s around.
today, she bangs the walls.
“i hate you! the water’s too wet!”
hanging onto the safety bars,
she pitches back and forth
like a child,
wanting to be let out at the gate.
i wash her back.
she spins around
in my soap-lathered hands,
and loosening her face in mine,
she glares.
she sticks out her tongue,
and biting down on it, she squeals,
jowls swinging, arms jiggling.
then, in a dive of both hands
between her legs,
she drops to a semi-squat, simian posture
and thrusts her pelvis bones forward
like mountains in an antediluvian upheaval.
in a gesture of obscenity,
she unfolds her petals
and displays her withered sex to me—
the same way boys moon, flip the bird
or grab their crotch and waggle their tongues—
the profane she feels but can’t articulate.

when i was three,
a tsunami hit town.
“daddy, daddy, save me,

“daddy, daddy, please save me,

but he let go of my hand!
i still dance

my son lives on the streets.
we don’t see each other much.
like a mother who puts white lilies
on the headstone of a dead child,
i put money into his bank account,
clothes into e-z access storage
and pretend he’s far away—
at a boarding school, or in a foreign country.
nights, i dream fairy tales about him.
i dream he becomes a prince,
scholar or warrior who rescues me
from sorrow, the way he rescued me
when he was a child and said,
“mommy, don’t cry,” and brought tea
into the room of his father’s acrimony—
brave, standing tall in the forest
fire of his father’s scorn. i wake
to the empty sound of wind in the trees.
he says he wants to live with me.
i say i can’t live with him—
boy whose words crash like branches in a rain storm.
nothing can hold him in,
the walls of a house too thin.
back home, i had seen
the “study-hard-so-you-don’t-become-like-them”
street bums on mamo street,
and he’s like them.
these days, in order to catch a glimpse of him,
i circle the city. one day,
i see him on his bike.
people give him wide berth,
the same way birds avoid power lines,
oncoming cars or trees.
i park on a side street.
wild-eyed, he flies the block
as if in a holding pattern.
not of my body, not of my hopes,
he homes in on what can’t be given or taken away.

in college, people were always breaking up.
we broke up in parking lots,
beside fountains.
two people broke up
across a table from me
at the library.
i could not sit at that table again
though i did not know them.
i studied bees, who were able
to convey messages through dancing
and could find their ways
home to their hives
even if someone put up a blockade of sheets
and boards and wire.
bees had radar in their wings and brains
that humans could barely understand.
i wrote a paper proclaiming
their brilliance and superiority
and revised it at a small café
featuring wooden hive-shaped honey-dippers
in silver honeypots
at every table.

it could have
happened to any
of us
a wrong turn
down a logging road
tires tunneled
into snow
a man’s undying
love for his children
moves satellites
maps aerial images
eighteen care packages
dropped over 16
miles of the siskiyou,
bearing handwritten
notes from a father
to his son
the signs
you left for those
who came after you
a red t-shirt
a wool sock,
a child’s blue skirt
layers of a life,
stripped down to
a family’s fate —
the weight of being
unseen — to travel
a path back to
what you knew
at birth, the warmth
of being held close
brought home

 we spend the afternoon together watching a docudrama about wild horses that roamed the ancient arctic circle. surprisingly sleek, built for speed and not the weather, they were remarkable for their recklessness. they careen headlong down ice bluffs to fall into a broken heap. we can hear the small, tinny sounds of their terror as they plunge across vast, glowing glacial faces. all of this takes place alongside an abstractly relentless gunmetal sea. i can feel you turn to me, wetness marking the corners of your lips and eyes. i, too, am mesmerized, my vision limited to a sense of motion on the peripheries. later, i am summoned for an impromptu scan and, miraculously, i pass.

my skin crawls at odd hours of the day, a residual effect of my recent radiation therapies, how they inadvertently synced me to coronal flares. during my morning tea, at the gym, during the drive back home. a simple turn transforms into an avalanching pinprick of tremors one millimeter thick. i’d have preferred a suppurative response—one that collects under the skin—to this invisible, blistering, cracklesome lightning scar. one can’t choose the mood that gathers, the body’s response.
the brightest moments of the day rarely correlate to a discharge. gray sky or blackness, a foggy haze aswirl between stars and nothing halts. some moments tear my teeth.
the news feed portends rolling blackouts across the state. i read over the last of my messages: a blanket request for a plasma donation, sasha asking if i want a ride to the wake.

how much chemical disorder
can be survived depends
on medical technology.
a hundred years ago, cardiac arrest was irreversible.
people were called dead
when their heart
stopped beating.
today death is
believed to occur 4
to 6 minutes after
the heart stops beating
because after
several minutes it is difficult
to resuscitate the brain.
however, with new experimental
treatments, more than
10 minutes of warm cardiac
arrest can
now be survived without
brain injury.
future technologies
for molecular repair may extend the
frontiers of resuscitation beyond
60 minutes or more,
making today’s
beliefs about
when death
occurs
obsolete
merely transitory evidence
a stray boundary between
a much longer-lasting
(invisible
opposite polarities
feature
the fields annihilate
the field tries to
one another
repel the intruder

something i learned about agape when i was young: the iliad tells
us fellow-feeling is finite in communities. brotherly love becomes a
number that has to be divided among persons—so if you’re too kind to
others, that might explain your neighbor’s graft. i sometimes wonder if
perception is the same; if the quantity of percepts, or our trove of eidetic
things, is not limitless but rather constant: the measure, say, of a sunlit
field. so if we dip like deep-sea divers to the world, we’ll have to use a
purse-seine to sieve our sense impressions. we’re hoarding the image
at our peril. that bluest scilla smeared by a finger writing in the grass?
endangered. poetry’s work is not to ravish, but diminish.

the coal-dust hushed
parameters of the room.
outside, my mother stitched
whole dresses for $3.00 a piece.
i slept in a bedroom
which faced the street.
a cheerleader was killed
in a drive-by that year.
she died in her sleep.
i watched the headlights
sweep overhead.
it felt like skin.
it did not
feel obscene.
when that boy
tongue-kissed me
and wiped
his mouth,
it was a coming
into knowledge.
when my mother whispered, has anyone touched you there?
i had to pick.
alan, i said.
i was seven.
the training wheels
were coming off.
between the couch
and wall, the ceiling was white
with popcorn bits. the boys stood
and watched. i lay there,
my eyes open like a doll’s.

then abruptly stopped.

i see my mother, at thirteen,
in a village so small
it’s never given a name.
monsoon season drying up—
steam lifting in full-bodied waves.
she chops bắp chuối for the hogs.
her hair dips to the small of her back
as if smeared in black
and polished to a shine.
she wears a deep side-part
that splits her hair
into two uneven planes.
they come to watch her:
americans, marines, just boys,
eighteen or nineteen.
with scissor-fingers,
they snip the air,
point at their helmets
and then at her hair.
all they want is a small lock—
something for a bit of good luck.
days later, my mother
is sent to the city
for safekeeping.
she will return home once,
only to be given away
to my father.

the cake is sweet

she opened her mouth and a moose came out, a donkey, and an ox—out of her mouth, years of animal grief. i lead her to the bed. she held my hand and followed. she said, chết rồi, and like that, the cord was cut, the thread snapped, and the cable that tied my mother to her mother broke. and now her eyes red as a market fish. and now, she dropped like laundry on the bed.
the furniture moved toward her, the kitchen knives and spoons, the vibrating spoons—they dragged the tablecloth, the corner tilting in, her mouth a sinkhole. she wanted all of it: the house and the car too, and the flowers she planted, narcissus and hoa mai, which cracked open each spring—the sky, she brought it low until the air was hot and wet and broke into a rain—
the torrents like iron ropes you could climb up, only i couldn’t. i was drowning in it. i was swirled in. i leapt into her mouth, her throat, her gut, and stayed inside with the remnants of my former life. i ate the food she ate and drank the milk she drank. i grew until i crowded the furnishings. i edged out her organs, her swollen heart. i grew up and out so large that i became a woman, wearing my mother’s skin.

 mid-october in central park, one of the elms
has changed early, burning with a light
grown accustomed to its own magnificence,
imperceptible until this moment when it becomes
more than itself, more than a ritual
of self-immolation. i think of sacrifice
as nourishment, the light feeding bark and veins
and blood and skin, the tree better off
for wanting nothing more. i used to imagine
the chakra like this—a hole in the soul
from the top of the head, where the light of knowing
can shimmer through. in the summer of 1979
i saw that light shoot from my brother’s forehead
as we sat chanting in a temple in manila.
he didn’t see it pulsing like a bulb in a storm,
but he said he felt the warmth that wasn’t warmth
but peace. and i, who have never been
so privileged, since then have wondered
if we believed everything because not to believe
was to be unhappy. i’ve seen that light elsewhere
—on a river in bangkok, or pixeled across
the shattered façades of prague—but it is here
where i perceive its keenest rarity, where i know
it has passed over all the world, has given shape
to cities, cast glamour over the eyes of the skeptic,
so that it comes to me informed with the wonder
of many beings. i can’t begin to say how infinite i feel,
as though i were one of many a weightless absence
touches, and out of this a strange transformation:
the soul ringed with changes, as old as a tree,
as old as light. i am always learning the same thing:
there is no other way to live than this,
still, and grateful, and full of longing.

the dry basin of the moon must have held
the bones of a race, radiant minerals,
or something devoid of genesis, angel-heavy,
idea-pure. all summer we had waited for it,
our faces off-blue in front of the tv screen.
nothing could be more ordinary—two figures
digging dirt in outer space—while mother repeated
neil armstrong’s words, like a prayer
electronically conveyed. the dunes were lit
like ancient silk, like clandestine pearl.
in the constant lunar night this luminescence
was all we hoped for. a creature unto itself,
it poured into the room like a gradual flood
of lightning, touching every object with the cool burn
of something not quite on fire. if we stepped out
manila would be blank ether, way station,
a breathless abeyance. it didn’t matter,
at that moment, where our lives would lead:
father would disown one brother,
one sister was going to die. not yet unhappy,
we were ready to walk on the moon. reckless
in our need for the possible, we knew
there was no turning back, our bags already packed,
the future a religion we could believe in.

 it takes just two people to bring the world
to ruin. so goes the history of love.
at the end of the day we tally the casualties
of war, victory for the one who gets wounded
the least. you say it’s time for a change
but i don’t know to what end, change being
just the skin of some incandescent creature
whose grotesque beauty is what we adore,
whom some people call love, whom we
venerate because it consumes us, slim pickings
for its huge soul. my people say, don’t look
or you’ll go blind. you say the end was always
just around the bend. i say all we have
is unconditional surrender to the future.
so unreliable is the past that i feel compelled
to leave unmourned the blind, relentless loves
that may have scorched into our hearts
the way the saints accepted stigmata. my people say,
look back or lose your way. or, walk backwards,
if you can. so i found myself on a bus to new york city
to lose myself completely. past hunters point
we hit the factory of souls—a thousand tombstones
from which a silk-like canopy of smoke rose to meet
god knows what—a spacious emptiness, the end.
i’ve heard the world’s never going to end.
i’ve heard it will go on and on, and we will be
as nebulous as nebuchadnezzar, our live
not worth a footnote, our grandest schemes
no more than feeble whispers, all memory
shifting like the continental plates. in the future,
all science will finally come around; genetic
engineering, i’ve been told, will be all the rage,
and we will be a super race in a world
infallibly perfected, where trains run on time,
love never dies, and hope can be purchased
by the pound. it’s called immortalization
of the cell lines. we will choose what will survive.
our destiny made lucid, we will find the world
contemplating itself, like the young narcissus,
one hand about to touch the pool, his body
lurched towards that marvelous reflection.
i suppose we’ve always felt compelled
to desensitize our failures. my people say,
to go unnoticed, you play dead. i myself
may have chosen to forget a face, a name,
some cruel word uttered carelessly, but not,
after all the harm is done, intending any pain.
and many others may have chosen to forget me.
it works both ways. my people say, nasa huliang pagsisi: regret is the final emotion.

you love to say the trees are naked now
because it never happens
in your country. this is a mystery
from which you will never
recover. and yes, the trees are naked now,
everything that still breathes in them
lies silent and stark

this, too, is a source

—no, forget it,
it’s still too early to make anyone understand.

after neil degrasse tyson, black astrophysicist & director of the hayden
planetarium, born in 1958, new york city. in his youth, degrasse tyson was
confronted by police on more than one occasion when he was on his way to
study stars.
“i’ve known that i’ve wanted to do astrophysics since i was nine years old, a first visit to the hayden planetarium...so i got to see how the world around me reacted to my expression of these ambitions. & all i can say is, the fact that i wanted to be a scientist, an astrophysicist, was, hands down, the path of most resistance...anytime i expressed this interest teachers would say, don’t you want to be an athlete? or, don’t you wanna...i wanted to become something that was outside of the paradigms of expectation of the people in power.
and i look behind me and say, well, where are the others who might have been this? and they’re not there. and i wonder, what is the [thing] along the tracks that i happened to survive and others did not? simply because of the forces that prevented it. at every turn. at every turn.”

body of space. body of dark.
body of light.
the skyview apartments
circa 1973, a boy is
kneeling on the rooftop, a boy who
(it is important
to mention here his skin
is brown) prepares his telescope,
the weights & rods,
to better see the moon. his neighbor
(it is important to mention here
that she is white) calls the police
because she suspects the brown boy
of something, she does not know
what at first, then turns,
with her looking,
his telescope into a gun,
his duffel into a bag of objects
thieved from the neighbors’ houses
(maybe even hers) & the police
(it is important to mention
that statistically they
are also white) arrive to find
the boy who has been turned, by now,
into “the suspect,” on the roof
with a long, black lens, which is,
in the neighbor’s mind, a weapon &
depending on who you are, reading this,
you know that the boy is in grave danger,
& you might have known
somewhere quiet in your gut,
you might have worried for him
in the white space between lines 5 & 6,
or maybe even earlier, & you might be holding
your breath for him right now
because you know this story,
it’s a true story, though,
miraculously, in this version
of the story, anyway,
the boy on the roof of the skyview lives
to tell the police that he is studying
the night & moon & lives
long enough to offer them (the cops) a view
through his telescope’s long, black eye, which,
if i am spelling it out anyway,
is the instrument he borrowed
& the beautiful “trouble” he went through
lugging it up to the roof
to better see the leopard body of
space speckled with stars & the moon far off,
much farther than (since i am spelling the thing
out) the distance between
the white neighbor who cannot see the boy
who is her neighbor, who,
in fact, is much nearer
to her than to the moon, the boy who
wants to understand the large
& gloriously un-human mysteries of
the galaxy, the boy who, despite “america,”
has not been killed by the murderous jury of
his neighbor’s imagination & wound. this poem
wants only the moon in its hair & the boy on the roof.
this boy on the roof of this poem
with a moon in his heart. inside my own body
as i write this poem my body
is making a boy even as the radio
calls out the missouri coroner’s news,
the ohio coroner’s news.
2015. my boy will nod
for his milk & close his mouth around
the black eye of my nipple.
we will survive. how did it happen?
the boy. the cops. my body in this poem.
my milk pulling down into droplets of light
as the baby drinks & drinks them down
into the body that is his own, see it,
splayed & sighing as a star in my arms.

maybe he will be (say it)
the boy on the coroner’s table
splayed & spangled
by an officer’s lead as if he, too, weren’t made
of a trillion glorious cells & sentences. trying to last.
leadless, remember? the body’s beginning,
splendored with breaths, turned,
by time, into, at least, this song.
this moment-made & the mackerel-“soul”
caught flashing inside the brief moment of the body’s net,
then, whoosh, back into the sea of space.
the poem dreams of bodies always leadless, bearing
only things ordinary
as water & light.

i adore you: you’re a harrowing event.
i like you very ugly, condensed to one
deep green pang. you cannot ask the simplest
question, your hold is all clutch and sinker.
cannibal old me,
with my heart up my throat, blasting on all sides
with my hundred red states. hidden little striver.
how not to know it, the waist-deep trance of you,
the cursing, coursing say of you. embarrassing today.
curiouser and curiouser,
your body is a mouth, is a night of travel, your body
is tripling the sideways insouciance. the muscle
in you knows gorgeous, in you knows tornadoes.
in an instant’s compass, your blood flees you like a cry.
you put on my heat,
(that’s the way you work) i’m a bandit gripping
hard on the steal. the substitutions come swiftly,
hungering down the valley, no one question to cover
all of living. i arrange myself in the order of my use.
you’re wrong and right
at the same time, a breathless deluxe and a devouring
chopping down the back door. you slap my attention
all over the dark. what’s in me like a chime?
sometimes, sometimes, i come to you for the surprise.

why, even regrets recede unexpectedly.

roads and rivers that lead away from the palace.

in a solitude full of wars and songs.
roads and rivers that lead away from the palace
never converge in that vast landscape;
in a solitude full of wars and songs,
the words remain light and fugitive.
never converge in that vast landscape
in the way that stars keep their distance.
the words remain light and fugitive
in an anticipation crossed with absence.

just as surely as i was a coward

be large with those small fears. the whole sky
has fallen on you and all you can do about it is
shout, dragging your fear-ettes by their pinked ears.
they dance a number now: consequence without
sequence. lovingly broadminded in their
realization and ruin, expert at the parting shot.
not so small after all, we micro to
macro, swelling to the horror shows
lifted from the sly ways of life.
you, both scorched and shining in the terror
of the equivocal moment, its box of cheeky
logics rattling cold certainties out of bounds
and into the plaits of a girl’s desirous ends.
a little debauched, the flirt in a freckling,
wondering spun to falling comes to this
pert contract of a paradox: saying things
because they will do no good, ringing change
in frumpy mono-determination, fruity and fruitless.
exploded out of shelter, the tides come roaring in.
let in the hoarse cassandras and the dull pain of the
storyteller. you’ve needed those eyes all along.
we thought them disconcerting at first,
but it’s the only way. you live here now

on the morning of the 20th national day
my uncle came home and told us:
“all our troops have got into position,
for the russians may throw an atom-bomb on us today.”
after breakfast he returned to the headquarters,
but i had to go to school and join the celebration.
the fear oppressed my back like a bag of sand.
i could not raise the little triangle flag in my hand,
nor could i shout slogans with my classmates.
during the break i called together my best friends
and told them what would occur on this day.
benli said, “i must go home
and tell my dad to kill all our chickens.”
qingping said, “i must tell my aunt
not to buy a sewing machine.
who would care about clothes if that happens.”
yimin and i said nothing,

we decided to go to the army,
for we did not want to be roasted at home

the sound of a guitar drifts through the air.
cupped in my hand, a snowflake quivers lightly.
thick patches of fog draw back to reveal
a mountain range, rolling like a melody.
i have gathered the inheritance of the four seasons.
there is no sign of man in the valley.
picked wild flowers continue to grow,
their flowering is their time of death.
along the path in the primordial wood
green sunlight flows through the slits.
a russet hawk interprets into bird cries
the mountain's tale of terror.
abruptly i cry out,
"hello, bai—hua—mountain."
"hello, my—child," comes the echo
from a distant waterfall.
it was a wind within a wind, drawing
a restless response from the land,
i whispered, and the snowflake
drifted from my hand down the abyss.

perhaps the final hour is come
i have left no testament
only a pen, for my mother
i am no hero

divides the ranks of the living and the dead
i can only choose the sky
i will not kneel on the ground
allowing the executioners to look tall
the better to obstruct the wind of freedom
from star-like bullet holes shall flow

the night: a black map
i've come home—the way back

when spring water and horse pills
become the words of night
when memory barks
a rainbow haunts the black market
my father's life-spark small as a pea
i am his echo
turning the corner of encounters
a former lover hides in a wind
swirling with letters
beijing, let me
toast your lamplights
let my white hair lead
the way through the black map
as though a storm were taking you to fly
i wait in line until the small window
shuts: o the bright moon

the last time he cut his mother’s hair
the rude morning sun
left no corner of her kitchen private,
the light surgically clean
where it fell on his scissors.
her hair fell in a blonde circle
on the lake blue tile—smell of coffee
and cinnamon; her laughing
shook her head, hold still, he said,
his hands surfeit with the curl
and softness of her hair.
three weeks after her death,
a stranger entered the salon
and settled in the chair.
she had the color and shape
of his mother’s hair,
and when he sunk his hands in it,
the texture, even cowlicks,
individual as freckles—same.
twice he had to leave the room,
and twice, he returned—still,
when he touched her hair, it blurred. hold still, he said, hold still.

 i wanted to give you something for your pain.
but not the drug du jour
or the kind word this side of cliché.
something you wouldn’t find on a talk show,
in a department store or dark alleyway.
i wanted to give you something for your pain
but i couldn’t imagine what.
frankincense, myrrh—even gold
seemed too plain (too plain and too gross).
i needed something that wouldn’t have occurred
to you or me, or even nature: a creature
more fabulous, more imaginary
than you’d find in a rain forest or tapestry
or pixel-loaded screen. some exotic anodyne
an alchemist or astrophysicist
would be envious of: a chemical reaction,
an astral refraction, an out-of-body,
out-of-mind, one-of-a-kind
transport from your pain, that would last
longer than a day, go deeper than the past.
i would have founded a whole new religion
if i thought that would suffice.
as for love—sacred, profane, or both—
i wanted to give you something
that didn’t arrive with a roll of the dice
and was hard to maintain and had a knack
for disappointing. i wanted to give you
something for your pain that didn’t smack
of a sorcerer’s trick, or a poet’s swoon,
or a psychiatrist’s quip. nothing too heavy
or spacey or glib. i’d have given you the moon
but it’s been done (and besides, its desolate dust
and relentless tendency to wane
might have only exacerbated your pain).
if i could have given you something
you could depend on, could always trust
without a second thought, i would have.
a splendid view, perhaps, or a strain
of music. a favorite dish. a familiar tree.
a visit from a genie who, in lieu of granting you
a wish, would tend subtly to your every need,
and never once tire, never complain.
but when all was said and done
(or hardly said, not nearly done)
i was as helpless as you. could you tell—
or were you so overcome your pain was all
that mattered? it seemed to me we were a kind
of kin: willing the mind its bold suspensions,
but the heart, once shattered, never quite matching
its old dimensions. and yet you persevered
in spite of pain, you knew to hold hope
as lightly as you held my hand (a phantom grasp,
a clasp that seemed to come from the other side).
and your genial smile made it plain: you were pleased
by my wish to please. and then you died.

one spring night, at the end of my street
god was lying in wait.
a friend and i were sitting in his new sedan
like a couple of cops on surveillance,
shooting the breeze to pass the time,
chatting up the daydreams, the raw deals,
all the wouda-coulda-shoulda’s,
the latest “can you believe that?”
as well as the little strokes of luck,
the so-called triumphs, small and unforeseen,
that kept us from cashing it all in.
and god, who’s famous for working
in mysterious ways and capable of anything,
took the form of a woman and a man,
each dressed in dark clothes and desperate enough
to walk up to the car and open the doors.
and god put a gun to the head of my friend—
right against the brain stem, where the orders go out
not only to the heart and the lungs
but to consciousness itself—a cold muzzle aimed
at where the oldest urges still have their day:
the one that says eat whatever’s at hand,
the one that wants only to fuck,
the one that will kill if it has to…
and god said not to look at him
or he’d blow us straight to kingdom come,
and god told us to keep our hands
to ourselves, as if she weren’t that kind of girl.
suddenly time was nothing,
our lives were cheap, the light in the car
cold, light from a hospital,
light from a morgue. and the moments
that followed—if that’s what they were—
arrived with a nearly unbearable weight,
until we had acquired
a center of gravity
as great as the planet itself.
my friend could hardly speak—
he was too busy trying not to die—
which made me chatter all the more,
as if words, even the most ordinary ones,
had the power to return us to our lives.
and behind my ad-libbed incantation,
my counterspell to fear, the orders
still went out: keep beating, keep breathing,
you are not permitted to disappear,
even as one half of god kept bitching
to the other half that we didn’t have
hardly no money at all, and the other half barked,
“i’m telling you to shut your mouth!”
and went on rummaging through the back seat.
and no one at all looking out their window,
no one coming home or going out…
until two tall neighbors came walking toward us
like unsuspecting saviors… and god grabbed
the little we’d been given, the little we still had,
and hustled on to the next dark street.

daily evasions, we shall climb the hill as the light empties

and the pleasure of speaking when one is suddenly there.
the upgrade from wary to tolerant to convivial,
so unlike two brisk bodies on a busy street
for whom a sudden magnetic attraction
is a mistake, awkwardness, something to be sorry for.
but to loiter, however briefly, in a clearing
where two paths intersect in the matrix of chance.
to stop here speaking the few words that come to mind.
a greeting. some earnest talk of weather.
a little history of the day.
to stand there then and say nothing.
to slowly look around past each other.
notice the green tang pines exude in the heat
and the denser sweat of human effort.
to have nothing left to say
but not wanting just yet to move on.
the tension between you, a gossamer thread.
it trembles in the breeze, holding
the thin light it transmits.
to be held in that
line of force, however briefly,
as if it were all that mattered.
and then to move on.
with equal energy, with equal pleasure.

there are those who will never return to us
as we knew them. who if they return at all
visit our sleep, or daydreams, or turn up in the features
of total strangers. or greet us face to face
in the middle of some rush hour street,
but from a great distance—and not in the full flush
of bodies that once wanted nothing more from us
than the laying of our hands upon them,
as a healer lays hands upon the afflicted.
there are those who by their absence are an affliction.
i imagine that sometimes in your dark bed
you still want to know why. why the man
you were just coming to love, who liked you close
as he raced through the city at night, why
he had to swerve suddenly. why he had to end up
on an operating table, dead. why you of all people
had to live, to repeat this unanswerable question.
i could tell you about a woman good at ritual
who, hardly believing in herself, was good
at making vows the two of us could believe.
then one day i had to drive her to an early flight.
the dawn was blinding. she was off to look for the soul
no one else could provide. but was this the way
to do it? she didn’t know. she wanted me
to tell her. tears down her face. and i kept driving.
i can look back and say: on that day, that’s when i died.
since then, you and i have had a hard time believing
anything could bring us back. and yet your brown body
breathes new life into a cotton print from the fifties,
and picks parsley from the garden for spaghetti carbonara,
and cues up mozart’s french horn solo, and fills up the kitchen
with the aroma of sourdough, and gets my body to anticipate
the taste of malt as the tops of american beer cans pop:
good rituals all, because they waited out our every loss, patient
with the slow coming back to our senses, undeterred by our neglect.
as if they knew all along how much we would need them.

whitman thought he could live with animals, they were
so placid and self-contained, not one of them dissatisfied.
i have lived with animals. they kept me up all night.
not only tom cats on the prowl, and neurotic rats
behind my baseboards, scratching out a slim existence.
there were cattle next door in the butcher’s pen,
great longhorns lowing in the dark. their numbers had come up
and they knew it. i let their rough tongues lick my sorry palm.
nothing else i could do for them, or they for me.
walt can live with the animals. i’ll take these vegetables on parade:
string-beans and cabbage heads and pea brains, who negotiate
a busy crosswalk and feel brilliant, the smallest act accomplished
no mean feat, each one guiding them to other small acts
that will add up, in time, to something like steady purpose.
they cling to this fate, clutch it along with their brownbag lunches:
none of us would choose it, but this is their portion, this moment,
then this one, then the next. little as it is, pitiful as it seems,
this is what they were given, and they don’t want to lose it.
the gawky and the slow, the motley and the misshapen…
what bliss to be walking in their midst as if i were one of them,
just ride this gentle wave of idiocy, forget those who profess
an interest in my welfare, look passing strangers in the eye
for something we might have in common, and be unconcerned if nothing’s there.
and now we peek into a dark café, and now we mug at the waitress
whose feet are sore, whose smile makes up for the tacky carnations
and white uniform makes it easy to mistake her for a nurse,
even makes it necessary, given the state of the world.
and when the giant with three teeth harangues us to hurry up,
what comfort to know he’s a friend, what pleasure to be agreeable,
small wonders of acquiescence, like obedient pets. except animals
don’t have our comic hope, witless as it is. they don’t get
to wave madly at the waitress, as though conducting a symphony
of ecstatic expectations. if i turned and lived with animals
i’d only be a creature of habit, i’d go to where the food is
and the warmth. but i wouldn’t get to say to my troubled friend,
“your eyes are so beautiful. i could live in them.”
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
inside me lived a small donkey. i didn’t
believe in magic, but the donkey
was a sucker for the stuff. psychics,
illusionists, arthritics who’d predict
the rainfall. that was the year i had trouble
walking. i over-thought it and couldn’t
get the rhythm right. the donkey re-taught me.
“this foot. yes, then that one. and swing
your arms as if you’re going to trial
to be exonerated of a crime
you’ve most definitely committed.”
next, trouble sleeping because
i’d need to crank the generator in my chest
so frequently. seeing i was overworked,
the donkey finally hauled it out—
it looked shiny and new, a silver dollar—
and tossed it into a flock of birds
who had to fly a long way to find safety.
i knew then i was a large and dangerous man,
what with this donkey living inside me,
but felt futile. one day, during
a final lesson on breathing,
the donkey asked what kind of jeans
i was wearing. i said, “the somber ones.”
“poor kid.” “so will you be staying on
for a third year, donkey?” “no. i think
i should be leaving soon. i think
i should go and await your arrival beside
the crumpled river.” “yes, i suppose
you have many important matters to attend to,
but maybe one day i will come and join you
for a drink or, perhaps, for a brief nap.”

i ask him, are you my friend? gravity telegraphs

nytimes headline for september 4th 2012:
elephants dying in epic frenzy as ivory fuels wars and profits
they return to the site whence they came with eyes tearful,
with psalms trumpeting the air.
they stand ever so watchful;
guarding the graves of their ghosts and their kind.
they shall not forget. they shall not want.
they lie down in green silky pastures
and finding their way to the still waters.
they restore and nourish their soul.
they walk through the dark valleys; always the shadows
of death lurking behind them.
always striding till they reach the comforting light.
they fear no evil. man fears.
they forage for food and they eat amongst their enemies
because they fear not. they are the happiest.
the honey is under their tongue.
the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.
their hearts awaken. they know no violence.
even in the waning light they tower over all else.
they are the landscape. they are the trees.
they throw up the dust in their dance. the skies become misty.
they rise up and lead each other away into the dusk.

on demarcations in the sandy vial
some tree spelling astronaut onto a
planet’s arm, it stopped making sense.
i am not an apothecary or a wave
or a dog by the 15th hole, i am not
a light sparking a whole country’s demise.
i will never be a towel holding someone’s
sunscreen while they wash it off in foreign
seas. my hair goes up and down, it’s true
as it is i am not a bag of tea nor will i ever
be exceptionally happy. let the director
know i was distressed by the construction
noise, that i had no known allergies that
my parents convinced me i was wanted
and why wouldn’t you believe them.
if the earth when it opened dragged away
our sense of faith, doubt was an
invention i preferred to ignore in the
manner of solicitations by mail.

after “she was the song of my dark hour,” a photograph by paul tañedo

its costs—
fil and eileen
educated themselves—
they blessed me
with their happiness—
roy and glen
lost themselves
to a car accident
and something worse
(that i will not reveal
even for a poem)—
when i see myself
reflected in a mirror
i turn away to hide
both my eyes, all of my self—
when half of your
children are destroyed
the half who flourish
cannot compensate
exactly
as if
a heart breaks exactly down the middle.

all that's left is the shroud
the back wings. roaches
scurrying in the kitchen. there’s no
greater threat than this time at hand.
drunken cackles from the street. still damp
from 4 am rain.
i missed the instructions for this part. the trap.
the deflate of dream. utopia was always
supposed to be right at hand. right and left.
any which way we’d make of it.
marine layer
won’t budge for the rumble under our feet. sky
tears open in the north. sirens
on high. a small pool forms
in the buckle of asphalt.
in its gentle tremble
the reflection of the grey
white mass overhead
with a perfect seam of blue.
the rift where
the dead speak
how-tos.

the number of bodies i have
is equal to the number of
gurney transfers that are

if we’re all “just human” 
then who is responsible?
a fire station drying out
from addiction. outside
the drizzling of firepower,
lowballing suns
it’s like a sauna in here.
the strain of a charred
bladder. bottled water
bad wiring,
that spark is no good
come sit with me for a
minute. my feet full of
diluted axe fluid
thought i heard you say
everything is medicine
but that’s just hearin

spoiler alert: in this all-but-forgotten
masterwork, jean stafford—who was once
widely regarded as the leading novelist
of her generation, and who wrote
this perverse, short,
lyrical novel, her second, during
the flailing failings
of her marriage to my hero
robert lowell—kills
molly, her child-alter ego,
a girl too unloved and unloving
to survive puberty, too
pure and awful—like stafford, who died
pickled and childish three
decades later after winning
the pulitzer with her devastating,
hurtfully compassionate collected stories—for this or any other world,
especially the necessarily
allegorical one of fiction.
i am broken now, hopeless; hope
is proved by this book to be
a contrivance. i have just
read the last pages in which
molly’s brother, ralph—who,
to live, cannot love
either, has no spare love—shoots
her, aiming for the wild mountain
lion whose stuffed corpse
was to be the triumph
of his new manhood. i don’t
hate ralph—how can i, a boy,
mistaken, like me? and can i hate
molly, who so needed ralph
and everyone, still young enough to savor
the bittersweet of her anger?
what about stafford, who hurt
herself, all our selves, with
this ending, her classic tragedy, writing,
decades later, poor old molly! i loved her dearly and i hope she rests in peace.
fuck insight and analysis:
my heart is shot. why
did she have to die? why does
anyone? why do you, do i?
because of what ralph was
feeling just before he accidentally
slaughtered the future? this book
must have ravaged the already
sleepless poet gregory orr,
who shot his brother, too, and
suffers that endless error
in poetry and prose. and because molly
refused everything, she stood between
ralph and tomorrow. but he grew, he
changed. confused? read
the book. in novels
people die because of what they feel.
in life, people die when
their bodies conk out,
exhausted machines that living
expends. and what
happens when people feel
their feelings in life?
nothing? anything? brenda,
dear brenda, my love, nothing
happens, i’m afraid. i’m sorry. and afraid.
a small breeze born in the heart
gently bends a blade of grass
and no one hears a word.
no one reads stafford anymore—i asked
on facebook. stafford died, her
legacy gently dispatched
into the low air. o, life
is terrible, literature
ridiculous. stafford’s prose,
teeming and rich as loam,
could take famous franzen’s
for a walk, feed it biscuits.
but who cares? who remembers?
o, to have been jean stafford,
in the past i idealize, when the world
was less self-conscious, less
precise. i could be
dead already, warmish
beneath a blanket of dust. joyful
are the faded, the once-greats
whose afterlives slipped out
a hole in posterity's pocket:
they are loved poignantly by
a needy few. o, to be kept
cozy in the bosoms of those
desperate and proud, forgotten
for all the good i do. love
is sunlight streaming unevenly
through the canopy of leaves
overhead. we can only grow
in the brighter patches below, fading
where light is thin. molly,
we are with you, nowhere and gone.
mostly we are forgotten, too.

i live with the small shame
of not knowing the multiple names for blue
to describe the nightsky over new mexico
to describe the light in my lover’s eyes.
it is a small shame that grows.
i live with the small shame
which resides in the absences of my speech
as i pause to search for the word in spanish
to translate a poem to my father
who sits there waiting
who scans my eyes to see
what i cannot fully describe
who waits for the word from me
the word that escapes me in the moment
the word i fear has never resided within me.
it is a small shame that grows
when indigo and cerulean are merely azul
and not añil and cerúleo.

with claims that if a frigid hell exists
the entrance is hidden somewhere in this city.
let us praise the immigrant
who fears the depths of the subway

who wakes each morning to the alien sight

hatred as an element of the struggle; a relentless hatred of the enemy, impelling us over and beyond the natural limitations that man is heir to and transforming him into an effective, violent, selective and cold killing machine. our soldiers must be thus; a people without hatred cannot vanquish a brutal enemy.

men like me in cuba

were rounded up in the middle of the night

when i was 7, i hoped rocks would whisper
the secret to being hard. fascinated by keisha’s skin
so soft, i seduced her into humping even though she
was five years my senior and my babysitter—click of the light
covers snatched away like a magic trick reveal
i could hear keisha wail one floor up
through the radiator pipes—i was the victim.
at 7, i decided i should’ve been born
a boy, a he, a him. blamed my mama for her mistake.
prayed for a penis and practiced peeing standing up
until it came: aim, angle of lean, and straddle were crucial.
toilet seat up, knees clamping the cool rim i let go
of the golden flow feeling the warm wet trickle down my legs
darkening my dungarees a new shade of blue.
at 7, i was never afraid of putting things in my mouth:
i chewed my fingernails till they bled, chewed pencils
till the yellow paint flaked me a crusty mustache,
chewed pen caps into odd sculptures, chewed pens until
the inky cylinders leaked a rorschach on my face
kids pointing as i ran to the bathroomoooh a butterfly! no, a thundercloud …
i wore my iron-on bruce lee sweatshirt till his face cracked
and faded invisible. still, i felt invincible when i wore it
kicking lunch tables with my shins. karate-chopping pencils
in two. forever trying to impress the skirts with my awkward
brand of goof. punching my arm to make lumps
rise out of the bony sinew. at 7, i knew
how to make a girl cry.

make her coffee, black.

dressed as metaphor,
begging for candy: trick

saturday afternoon: in the driveway between buildings they blow up
balloons—yellow, red, blue—for a 3-year-old’s party.
the intermittent pops startle me like random gunfire—remind me
of birthdays brown boys will no longer celebrate.
the dj, having set up the speakers, begins to play—the music, a rapid fire
of bass thump, commandeers the apartment. we have no choice but leave.
an art show: canvases colored with boxes and lines—a grid of red
on a backdrop of yellow. we speak of the abstract with wine in our mouths.
meanwhile, in an antechamber, six are sequestered. they speak of malicious intent, blood, evidence, testimony—murder versus manslaughter.
we arrive home to a throng of brown bodies, hands clutching red cups,
and music: its insistent treble stabbing the ears.
inside, we slam all windows, but the music still blares as my niece shoots
people on the video game—its sounds are too realistic to bear.
instead, the news, a verdict is in: not guilty. and everything is a blur
of sound, my heart beating so fast i put a hand to my chest.
i watch the tv screen: a collage of abstractions—spotlights, microphones,
smiles, handwritten signs. i stare, as if it were a painting—
a smear of twisted faces smothered in gesso and oil, a grid of red
on a backdrop of yellow—to make sense of.
the party continues. the 3-year-old probably in bed dreaming of melted
ice cream, and i am tired of partying.
there is a police station a half block away and i want it to burn. instead,
only the smoke of weed, the meaningless music droning on,
the popping of balloons. sunday morning, the birds are angry—their
chirping a noisy chant: no no no no. outside, the rubbery flesh
of balloons color the driveway like splotches of paint. in an instant,
those still lives of heave and breath—gone in a pop.

it showed the war was as my father said:
boredom flanked by terror, a matter of keeping
low and not freezing. “you wore your helmet
square,” he said, not “at some stupid angle,
like that draft-dodger wayne,” who died
so photogenically in the sands of iwa jima.
those nights i heard shouts from the dark
of my parents’ room, he was back down
in his foxhole, barking orders, taking fire
that followed him from france and germany,
then slipped into the house, where it hunkered
in the rafters and thrived on ambush. we kept
our helmets on, my mother and i,
but there was no cover, and our helmets
always tilted. he’d lump us with the ones
he called “johndoes,” lazy, stupid, useless.
we needed to straighten up and fly right,
pick it up, chop chop, not get “nervous
in the service.” we’d duck down like gis
where german snipers might be crouched
in haylofts, their breaths held for the clean shot.
“bang,” my father said, “the dead went down,
some like dying swans, some like puppets
with their strings cut.” i wanted to hear more,
but he’d change the subject, talk about
the pennant, the cards’ shaky odds, how musial
was worth the whole johndoe lot of them.

how burdensome they seemed, wartime
oldies that could drive our parents teary:
“i’ll be seeing you,” with its hint
of being swept off in a global riptide;
or the shaky follow-up of “i’ll be home
for christmas,” followed by a shakier
“don’t sit under the apple tree
(with anyone else but me),” “comin’
in on a wing and a prayer,” or “ac-
cent-tchu-are the positive.” we suffered
them on the old cathedral radio, crooned
by crosby and sinatra, had to watch them
strangled on the lawrence welk show
or laced with como’s heavy dose
of sedative. dad told us, “straighten up
and fly right.” mom hummed, “keep
the home fires burning”—till our music
cut the cord. brash and free of corn,
it hailed rock ‘n’ roll, caught maybellene
at the top of the hill, moaned “m’ baby-doll,
m’ baby-doll, m’ baby-doll.” we played it
loud and often, but they never understood.

when the junkies my father sold crack to got
too close to me, he told them to back up
six dicks’ lengths. this is the man who when i was
seven caught me under the bed crying and said:
save those tears. you’ll need them later.
the man who told me he smoked crack
because he liked it, the man sitting on his couch
now watching the history channel, scratching
the nub beneath his knee where his leg used to be,
gumming plums, his false teeth
soaking in vinegar on the table. i’m sitting
across the room trying to conjure each version
he’s shown of himself, trying to lie
in water warm enough
to soak away the switch he hit me with.
to help me summon love for the man
who just asked me if he can borrow 200 dollars,
the man who once told me: wish
in one hand, then shit in the other, and see which one fills up the quickest.

we shouldn’t raise mixed babies in the south, kay says as i drive up the crest
of another hill on our way into kentucky.
the south, where humidity leaves
a sweat mustache, where a truck
with a confederate flag painted
on the back windshield skitters in front
of us. in its bed, avoiding our eyes,
a boy with blond hair
split down the middle like a bible
left open to the book of psalms.
his shirtless, sun-licked skin drapes,
a thin coat for his bones, his clavicles sharp.
i want to know who’s driving this raggedy truck.
i want the boy to look at us. i want
to spray paint a black fist over that flag.
i want the truck to find its way
into the ravine. i want to—
stepping on the gas, i pass the truck,
kay and i turn our heads. the boy smiles
and waves. the man driving doesn’t
turn his head, keeps his eyes on the road. kay
turns red as she draws her fingers
into fists. i stare at the whites of her eyes.

i swear on the melody of trumpet vines,
ants feasting through animal crackers, burt’s bees,
tyler perry movies, my daddy’s .38 slug, footie-socks
inside high-top jordans, disidentification, drag
queens, blond dreadlocks, headstones
salt-and-peppering the grass, vanilla wafers
in banana pudding, zeus-swan chasing,
blunt-guts, sharp thumbnails, keloid scars,
cash-only bars, r&b songs, on what the pot
called the kettle. i put that on my mama’s good
hair, on playing solitaire with a phantom
limb, the white woman i go home to,
my auntie’s face when she says: you know he always loved them pink toes. i put that on
everything, on the signifiers i gobble up,
candlesticks blown out by whistling lips.
i put that on dervishing records scratched
on down-beats, empty beehives,
fresh-fade head-slaps, hand claps, bamboo shoots,
liminality, mestizos, the purple-black crook
of my arm, split sternums, on you can’t save him now. i put that on skinny jeans, get rich
quick schemes—gotta get that c.r.e.a.m. know what i mean?—freckled black faces, leafless trees
throwing up gang signs, phlegm hocked
onto streets. i swear i catch more stones
than catfish. i lose more collard greens than sleep. i think
nothing is here but us darkies, high yellows, red bones,
cocoa butters. someone, no, everyone has jungle fever. don’t touch my forehead. blond
as moonshine, mute trombone choking.
i put that on instagram. post me to the endless chain
of signifiers. strawberry gashes on kneecaps, let me get some dap, newports, kool’s, and folding
chairs instead of barstools, that white drool
caked on your face. mommy please wipe away the veil. i thought i was passing into the eye of the streetlamp. i swear. i promise on frondless
palm trees, long pinkie nails, sixteen years, serve eight,
and miss addie’s red beans and rice, ol’ dirty bastard
and the brother on the cream of wheat box. it don’t mean a thing if it don’t buckle your knees. open your hands.
i’ll give you a song, give you the holy ghost
from a preacher’s greasy palm—when he hit me, i didn’t
fall, felt eyes jabbing me, tagging me. oh no he didn’t!—
give you the om from the small of her back.
i put that on double consciousness, multiple jeopardy,
and performativity. please make sure my fetters and manacles are tight. yea baby, i like bottomless bullet chambers. i swear on the creation of uncle tom—
some white woman's gospel. she got blue eyes? i love me some—on josiah henson, the real uncle tom, on us still
believing in uncle tom. lord, have mercy!
put that on the black man standing on my shoulders holding
his balls. put that on the black man i am—i am not—on

she cannot imagine it otherwise.
she wakes in the morning and twists her ring,
loves how every night in their bed he lies
breathing warm in the dark and never shies
away. he lets her talk, he lets her sing.
she cannot imagine it otherwise.
one night she’s surprised how gently he tries
to move her arm when he thinks she’s sleeping.
in the night, in their bed, she sees he lies
watching the ceiling long before sunrise.
too much coffee, too many late nights working.
she cannot imagine it otherwise.
he quiets. the more she worries and pries
the less he tells her about anything.
she’s sure every night in their bed he lies
wanting a room beyond reach of her eyes.
he sighs—she cries so much, over nothing.
she cannot imagine it otherwise:
every night in their bed, he lies.

the woman carried the bucket
and the man was the wall.
there was no place else to go.
it was a long, long time
for there was much to carry
and there was much to wall.
there was a path ran straight
from the well to the hole in the wall.
there was a path ran crooked

let it finally be friday, let me drive
downtown before five, park in the one
space left open in front and feed the meter
the exact change it needs. let me go into the office,
sit and nod, unfold my check on the table
and sign. let the line not be dotted, let it
be solid. let it be my name.
let it be final.
let me pull into the driveway while
it is still light. it’s well past five and well
into october and they are just about
to change the time. saturday night
on the local news they’ll remind
us all to fall back, but i make it in
under the wire. there is still light.
there is still time.
i am up the back porch steps, under
the awning, my hand on the back door lock
the realtor left on. let me remember rightly
the numbers he gave me. let this not be the dream
of the high school locker with the master lock
whose combination you forgot or fumbled, turning
too fast, going too far, everything you’d locked up
irretrievable, lost.
let the lock fall open, let me leave it
on the steps for the realtor to pick up.
let him pull up the flimsy stakes
of the sign in the yard that says i can be bought,
let him drive away. let no master
enter through my door.
let the house be a disaster, i don’t care.
let the smoke-framed blanks where another
woman’s pictures marked the wall be the story
of how my edges caught fire and the ash at last
let me see where i stood. let the cracked
kitchen floor make a map to teach me
where not to step, how not to fall through
and break my very own back.
let the broken window be a way out,
the broken door a way in. let me go
to the hardware store and buy the tools
to take the chain off the bedroom door,
let me paint the bathroom pink without asking,
walk naked and unafraid through all my rooms.
let me pick up a broom and sweep
nothing under the rug. let me sweep it all
into the light. let me do it. let there be time.
let there be light.

doesn’t come with feathers.
it lives in flip-flops and, in cold weather,
a hooded sweatshirt, like a heavyweight
in training, or a monk who has taken
a half-hearted vow of perseverance.
it only has half a heart, the hope i know.
the other half it flings to every stalking hurt.
it wears a poker face, quietly reciting
the laws of probability, and gladly
takes a back seat to faith and love,
it’s that many times removed
from when it had youth on its side
and beauty. half the world wishes
to stay as it is, half to become
whatever it can dream,
while the hope i know struggles
to keep its eyes open and its mind
from combing an unpeopled beach.
congregations sway and croon,
constituents vote across their party line,
rescue parties wait for a break
in the weather. and who goes to sleep
with a prayer on the lips or half a smile
knows some kind of hope.
though not the hope i know,
which slinks from dream to dream
without id or ally, traveling best at night,
keeping to the back roads and the shadows,
approaching the radiant city
without ever quite arriving.

the god in me does not honor
the god in you. the god in you
murdered me once, and once
was more than enough.
so the god in me, adept
at keeping my nature warm
and inspired to love the benign,
now prefers the chilly air
of indifference, something picked up
like a virus from the most vicious
of mortals. the god in me
regards the god in you
as suspect, though sad
to say, it wasn’t always so.
there were the generous days
in the beginning, when every word
was made flesh. in the beginning
the gods in us were content
to let us go on
behaving like perfect mortals,
which is to say imperfectly,
which is to say with our tenderness
fully intact: the good kind
that let us gladly undress
our trepidations, and pleasure
our solitude into a blissful
oblivion; and the bad kind—
invisible woundings
no compliment or hot kiss,
no confession of the amorous
could soothe for long.
and then, when the mortals we were
had done enough to remind us
that to be mortal is to be susceptible
to the secret agenda, the cruel caprice,
the soft but eviscerating voice—
“at the mercy of a nuance”—
the god in you decided it was time
to act. a dark god, in need
of a human sacrifice, smoothly turning your back
on the earnest and their pathetic pleas.
so the god in me, no stranger to the aberrant
and the abhorrent, now has no choice
but to respond in kind. a pity, really,
since it has been the dream
of so many gods to find themselves
in some quiet room, the burden of power
slipped off and scattered
like clothes across the floor, the light
of late afternoon a kind of benediction,
and everywhere the gratitude
for the privilege of feeling
almost human.

when, in the science museum, i arrive at the overview
of our galaxy, with its tiny arrow pointing to you are here
(which really ought to be we are here), and see
that the two to four hundred billion stars of our local cluster
are drifting or chasing or dreaming after each other
in circles within milky circles, i can’t help but think
of those ancient paintings and rock engravings,
discovered all over our celestial body,
of that one line which begins at whatever point
it can, then curls outward, or inward, toward nothing
anyone can define—the oldest shape revered
by aborigine and celt, by mathematician
and engineer and burning man reveler alike,
and even accorded a place of honor among the mess
of thoughts on my desk, as a nifty paper clip of copper.
but it’s already there in the florets of the sunflower
crisscrossing with the precision of a logarithm,
and in the pin-wheel shape of the nautilus shell,
and in the coiling neurons of the cochlea
that let us tell art tatum from a three year old’s improvisation.
call it what you will—“god's fingerprint,” “the soul
unfolding through time,” “the passageway into the self”—
i can’t help but admire, even fear, something as mundane
as a flush of the toilet, when its swirling is a variation
on our sidereal drift, our existential pain.
and then there’s that famous falcon, “turning and turning
in a widening gyre,” a portentous symbol of our own
circling into some dread, some pernicious chaos
we thought we had just escaped, one town burning
a decade behind us, a millennium before that,
and into next week, next year, next whenever.
and when the two of us took that winding road
an infinity of others had wound down before us
and would wind down again, our spirits hushed
by the crosses and bouquets at each dead man’s curve
and just burning in the dry heat to touch each other,
wasn’t that a wondrous and terrible turning?

elle’s writing her book of wisdom.
she writes until she cannot hold her pen.
the labyrinth miraculously is uncovered.
an american woman’s progressing on her knees.
she read something but not elle’s book.
no one will read elle’s book.
i walk the circular path, first the left side,
then the right, casting petals to the north,
east, south, and west (this intuitively).
a diminutive prelate shoos me away.
when he leaves, i return to the center.
the organist, practicing, strikes up phantom.
elle says she cannot hear him. elle! i cry, i cannot see you. i had prayed death spare you.
remember our meal among the termites of arcadia street, that cottage of spirits with its riddled beams and long veranda
bordered by plantain trees, and the spiral you traced for me on scrap-paper? i kept it for such a long time.
the organist, of course, is playing bach.
a boy has scattered the petals i threw.
elle’s voice surrounds me.
the quiet hills i lift mine eyes.

there was an ancient well-site beneath the labyrinth
i did not reach, the part underground,
labeled (what else?) the crypt.
but labels always hide something
about what they seem to define.
they set the thing apart
without disclosing why.
alive costs a pretty penny
to see the crypt now.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
everything looped, spiraled, circular (thought)
but the labyrinth’s not a maze but a singular way
to strike “the profoundest chord” across aspire
those who enter the labyrinth can leave
(pilgrims sometime don’t)
(elle did not)
inside the largest circle
(the labyrinth itself)
splits into equal parts
(demi-arcs or waves)
no, silly, elle whispers, petals
if measured through the centre of the petals there should be two parts for each
petal and one for the entry, but calculations from the measurements show that
this is not so. the difference is about ½”. there is no way around this problem.
we must seek a solution
to the geometry of petals,
the consequential mystery
of elle’s message:
i was sick and am not healed.
i am not blind but dead.
i am not dead but silenced.
alone, in love.

soon as the sun forsook the eastern main
the pealing thunder shook the heav'nly plain;
majestic grandeur! from the zephyr's wing,
exhales the incense of the blooming spring.
soft purl the streams, the birds renew their notes,
and through the air their mingled music floats.
through all the heav'ns what beauteous dies are spread!
but the west glories in the deepest red:
so may our breasts with ev'ry virtue glow,
the living temples of our god below!
fill'd with the praise of him who gives the light,
and draws the sable curtains of the night,
let placid slumbers sooth each weary mind,
at morn to wake more heav'nly, more refin'd;
so shall the labours of the day begin
more pure, more guarded from the snares of sin.
night's leaden sceptre seals my drowsy eyes,
then cease, my song, till fair aurora rise.

this morning i was walking upstairs
from the kitchen, carrying your
beautiful flowers, the flowers you
brought me last night, calla lilies
and something else, i am not
sure what to call them, white flowers,
of course you had no way of knowing
it has been years since i bought
white flowers—but now you have
and here they are again. i was carrying
your flowers and a coffee cup
and a soft yellow handbag and a book
of poems by a chinese poet, in
which i had just read the words “come
or go but don’t just stand there
in the doorway,” as usual i was
carrying too many things, you
would have laughed if you saw me.
it seemed especially important
not to spill the coffee as i usually
do, as i turned up the stairs,
inside the whorl of the house as if
i were walking up inside the lilies.
i do not know how to hold all
the beauty and sorrow of my life.

three weeks until summer and then—what?
midsummer’s gravity makes our heads spin
each hour a gilt thread spool, winding through
the second hand, gossamer fin de semaine, fin de siècle, fin slicing the water
of the too-cold-to-breathe bay, molten silver,
then receding as if we hadn’t seen it,
sultan of so long, see you tomorrow.
dead man’s fingers, lady’s slippers, a seal
who swims too close—too close for what? the needle
swerves. our element chooses us. water
fire, air, earth—the rosebush, lazarus,
hot to the touch, gold reticulate, is love’s
bull’s-eye, attar rising from the rafters.
if i could make it stop i would. was it
the crocodile hook feared, or was it time?
the hour’s arrow never misses, the gnomon,
glinting, cuts the day-glo sun to pieces.
in the ultraviolet palace of the mermaid king
his girls wear scallop shells, one for each year
on their turquoise tails. even they have birthdays,
why not you? death, hold your ponies with one
hand, and stay awhile. on my desk, the lion’s
paw lamps scavenged from the winter beach,
its poppy-colored shells like the lit scales
of an enormous trojan fish … teeth chattering,
its metronome time bomb tsk tsk—
when is giving up not giving in?
when alice pulled the stopper, did she get
smaller, or did the world get larger? in
the bath, your nose bleeds a bouquet of tissue
roses, white stained red—adolescence
is to overdo it, but really? thirty
stories up, our birds’-eye view is
the hummingbird tattoo on your bare head,
wings beating, too tiny and too big to see,
your wire-thin profile drawn upright, bones
daring the air, marionette running on
the brain’s dark marrow, tungsten for the fireflies’
freeze tag. due south, the chrysler building’s gauntlet
holds a lit syringe. we do and do not change.
let me go from here to anywhere.
that’s it for now. and so we turn the page
your poems standing in for you, or—that’s
not it, what’s left of you, mediating
between what you’d call mind and body
and i, by now biting my lip, call grief,
the lines netting the enormous air
like silver threads, the tails of mr. edwards’s
spiders with which they sail from ledge to branch
“as when the soul feels jarred by nervous thoughts
and catch on air.” pace. your trousers worn
to mouse fur dragging on the stoop, your hip
prongs barely holding them aloft, the past
a phaeton, its sunlit reins bucking
at before and after, but there is no after.
or is there? for once, when you rock back
on the chair i don’t say don’t do that,
forelegs lifting, hooves pawing the air—
every departure’s an elopement,
the shy cat fiddling while rome sizzles,
spoon mirror flipping us upside down.
son of helios, rainbow fairy lights
blazing, when one light goes out they all
go out. at the top of the dune, the thorny
crowns of buried trees, their teeter-totter
branches a candelabra for the spiders’
silvery halo of threads. what a terrible
business it is, saying what you mean.
speak, sky, the horizon scored by talons.

our labor realized in the crowns
of marigolds, blue eyes of the hydrangeas,
smell of lavender and late bloom of the hosta’s
erect purple flower with its marvel of thick
green leaves. in our twilight
every year we trimmed back and the garden grew
more lustrous and untamable as if the eternal woods
and animals asleep at night in its beds were claiming it back.
the water in the pool shimmered an icy tuscan blue.
when we arrived we swam
until the stress from the grueling
life in the city released our bodies. later
we sat under the umbrella and watched a garter snake
slip into the water, careful not to startle
its flight-or-fight response. its barbed-wire
coil. comet of danger, serpent of the water,
how long we had thwarted the venom of its secret
lures and seductions.
it swam by arching then releasing
its slithery mercurial form.
through the lanky trees
we heard the excited cries
of the neighbor’s children—ours, the boy in our late youth,
of our happiness and our struggles, the boy who made us whole
and broken, was in his room perhaps dreaming
of a girl and sleeping the long, tangled sleep of a teenager.
it was a miracle, our ignorance. it was grace
incarnate, how we never knew.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
we loved them.
we got up early
to toast their bagels.
wrapped them in foil.
we filled their water bottles
and canteens. we washed
and bleached their uniforms,
the mud and dirt
and blood washed clean
of brutality. we marveled
at their bodies,
thighs thick as the trunk
of a spindle pine,
shoulders broad and able,
the way their arms filled out.
the milk they drank.
at the plate we could make out
their particular stance, though each
wore the same uniform as if they were
cadets training for war.
if by chance one looked up at us
and gave us a rise with his chin,
or lifted a hand, we beamed.
we had grown used to their grunts,
mumbles, and refusal to form a full sentence.
we made their beds and rifled through their pockets
and smelled their shirts to see if they were clean.
how else would we know them?
we tried to not ask too many questions
and not to overpraise.
sometimes they were ashamed of us;
if we laughed too loud,
if one of us talked too long to their friend,
of our faces that had grown coarser. can’t you put on lipstick?
we let them roll their eyes,
curse, and grumble at us
after a game if they’d missed a play
or lost. we knew to keep quiet;
the car silent the entire ride home.
what they were to us was inexplicable.
late at night, after they were home in their beds,
we sat by the window and wondered
when they would leave us
and who they would become
when they left the cocoon of our instruction.
what kind of girl they liked.
we sat in a group and drank our coffee
and prayed that they’d get a hit.
if they fumbled a ball or struck out
we felt sour in the pit of our stomach.
we paced. we couldn’t sit still or talk.
throughout summer we watched
the trees behind the field grow fuller
and more vibrant and each fall
slowly lose their foliage—
it was as if we wanted to hold on
to every and each leaf.

 “a fine sunday in bath empties every house of its inhabitants, and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is.” —northanger abbey
i awoke from the tunnel
to the fields of yellow rape,
seventeenth-century buildings, and cobbled
streets as she would have seen them.
it was rainy; the rain came and went,
came and went so that you could not escape
its dampness. i understood the need for tea
and the luxury of cremes and pastries
and why the ladies longed for a strong shoulder
to see them through the winter.
the seagulls cried overhead,
though there was no sea, only a muddy river
from bath to bristol. the scavengers
lived on the rooftops and if desperate
enough would swoop down and take
a sandwich from your hand.
i secured my room at the royal bath hotel.
it was a hovel, really, with a carpet
as old as the early century.
walking through the hotel,
i sensed something lurid
in the air, every eye upon me as if they knew
i was a foreigner in a strange land.
over the bed, a burgundy bedspread
dusty and faded as vintage wine,
made me long for the bright color of red.
in the next room, sleepless, i heard
through thin walls the sounds
of an un-tender coupling.
i looked in the warped mirror
and found myself ugly
and when i turned from it,
could not escape the vision.
it lingered. the rain came and went,
came and went. i took an umbrella
and began my walk, hoping to come upon
her quarters. i passed the roman baths,
the statues not beautiful,
but puckered and fossilled
and the pump room where her protagonist,
other self, doppelgänger,
good, strong, loyal catherine,
longing for companionship, fell
under the seduction of isabella
and her reprehensible brother.
even then her coming out
seemed less magisterial,
and bath a representation of the emptiness
and evils of society where a woman’s dowry
might confine her forever,
than a reprieve from country life.
i gave up my search.
images were everywhere.
and my mind had been made up.
i perceived no romance
in the wind, no comfort in the hard
glances of strangers, girls with chipped nail polish,
lads unkempt as if there were no hope of glory.
the next morning i boarded the train
to the modern world and it wasn’t until a sheet
of blue slipped out like a love letter
from its envelope of dark gray sky
that i knew the journey had ended
and, like catherine, i was finally safe.

even now, after twice her lifetime of grief
and anger in the very place, whoever comes
to climb these narrow stairs, discovers how
the bookcase slides aside, then walks through
shadow into sunlit room, can never help
but break her secrecy again. just listening
is a kind of guilt: the westerkirk repeats
itself outside, as if all time worked round
towards her fear, and made each stroke
die down on guarded streets. imagine it—
four years of whispering, and loneliness,
and plotting, day by day, the allied line
in europe with a yellow chalk. what hope
she had for ordinary love and interest
survives her here, displayed above the bed
as pictures of her family; some actors;
fashions chosen by princess elizabeth.
and those who stoop to see them find
not only patience missing its reward,
but one enduring wish for chances
like my own: to leave as simply
as i do, and walk at ease
up dusty tree-lined avenues, or watch
a silent barge come clear of bridges
settling their reflections in the blue canal.

by noon your breathing had changed from normal
to shallow and panicky. that’s when the nurse said nearly there now, in the gentle voice of a parent
comforting a child used to failure, slipping her arms
beneath your shoulders to hoist you up the pillows,
then pressing a startling gauze pad under your jaw.
nearly there now. the whole world seemed to agree—
as the late april sky deepened through the afternoon
into high august blue, the vapour trails of two planes
converged to sketch a cross on the brow of heaven.
my brother kit and i kept our backs turned to that
except now and again. it was the room i wanted to see,
because it contained your last example of everything:
the broken metal window-catch that meant no fresh air;
your toothbrush standing to attention in its plastic mug;
the neutral pink walls flushed into definite pale red
by sunlight rejoicing in the flowering cherry outside;
your dressing-gown like a stranger within the wardrobe
eavesdropping. that should have been a sign to warn us,
but unhappiness made us brave, or do i mean cowardly,
and kit and i talked as if we were already quite certain
you could no longer hear us, saying how easy you were
to love, but how difficult always to satisfy and relax—
how impossible to talk to, in fact, how expert with silence.
you breathed more easily by the time we were done,
although the thought you might have heard us after all,
and our words be settling into your soft brain like stones
onto the bed of a stream—that made our own breathing
tighter. then the nurse looked in: nothing will change here for a while boys, and we ducked out like criminals.
i was ordering two large gins in the pub half a mile off
when my mobile rang. it was the hospital. you had died.
i put my drink down, then thought again and finished it.
five minutes later we were back at the door of your room
wondering whether to knock. would everything we said
be written on your face, like the white cross on the heavens?
of course not. it was written in us, where no one could find it
except ourselves. your own face was wiped entirely clean—
and so, with your particular worries solved, and your sadness,
i could see more clearly than ever how like mine it was,
and therefore how my head will eventually look on the pillow
when the wall opens behind me, and i depart with my failings.

28 june 1914
although an assassin has tried
and failed to blow him to pieces earlier this morning,
archduke ferdinand has let it be known
he will very soon complete his journey
as planned along the quay in sarajevo.
for a moment, however,
he has paused to recover his composure
at the window of a private room in the town hall,
after finding the blood of his aide-de-camp
spattered over the manuscript of the speech
he was previously unable to complete.
and indeed,
the prospect of an austrian brewery in the distance
is reassuring,
likewise the handsome bulk of the barracks
filled with several thousand soldiers of the fatherland.
this is how those who survive today will remember him:
a man thinking his thoughts
until his wife has finished her duties—
the countess chotek, with her pinched yet puddingy features,
to whom he will whisper shortly,
‘sophie, live for our children’,
although she will not hear.
as for his own memories:
the head of the local tourist bureau has now arrived
and taken it upon himself to suggest
the archduke might be happy to recall the fact
that only last week he bagged his three thousandth stag.
was this, the head dares to enquire,
with the double-barrelled mannlicher
made for him especially—
the same weapon he used to dispatch
two thousand one hundred and fifty game birds
in a single day,
and sixty boars in a hunt led by the kaiser?
these are remarkable achievements
the head continues,
on the same level as the improvement
the archduke has suggested in the hunting of hare,
by which the beaters,
forming themselves into a wedge-shape,
squeeze those notoriously elusive creatures
towards a particular spot
where he can exceed the tally of every other gun.
in the silence that follows
it is not obvious whether the archduke
has heard the question.
he has heard it.
he is more interested, however,
in what these questions bring to mind:
an almost infinite number of woodcock,
pigeon, quail, pheasant and partridge,
wild boars bristling flank to flank,
mallard and teal and geese
dangling from the antlers of stags,
layer and layer of rabbits
and other creatures that are mere vermin—
a haul that he predicts will increase
once the business of today has been completed.

general petraeus, when the death-count of american troops
in iraq was close to 3,800, said ‘the truth is you never do get
used to losses. there is a kind of bad news vessel with holes,
and sometimes it drains, then it fills up, then it empties again’—
leaving, in this particular case, the residue of a long story
involving one soldier who, in the course of his street patrol,
tweaked the antenna on the tv in a bar hoping for baseball,
but found instead the snowy picture of men in a circle talking,
all apparently angry and perhaps jihadists. they turned out to be
reciting poetry. ‘my life’, said the interpreter, ‘is like a bag of flour
thrown through wind into empty thorn bushes’. then ‘no, no’, he said,
correcting himself. ‘like dust in the wind. like a hopeless man.’

i am downstairs early
looking for something to do
when i find my father on his knees
at the fireplace in the sitting-room
sweeping ash
from around and beneath the grate
with the soft brown hand-brush
he keeps especially for this.
has he been here all night
waiting to catch me out?
so far as i can tell
i have done nothing wrong.
i think so again
when he calls my name
without turning round;
he must have seen me
with the eyes in the back of his head.
‘what’s the matter old boy?
couldn’t sleep?’
his voice is kinder than i expect,
as though he knows
we have in common a sadness
i do not feel yet.
i skate towards him in my grey socks
over the polished boards of the sitting-room,
negotiating the rugs
with their patterns of almost-dragons.
he still does not turn round.
he is concentrating now
on arranging a stack of kindling
on crumpled newspaper in the fire basket,
pressing small lumps of coal
carefully between the sticks
as though he is decorating a cake.
then he spurts a match,
and chucks it on any old how,
before spreading a fresh sheet of newspaper
over the whole mouth of the fireplace
to make the flames take hold.
why this fresh sheet
does not also catch alight
i cannot think.
the flames are very close.
i can see them
and hear them raging
through yesterday’s cartoon of president kennedy
and president khrushchev
racing towards each other in their motorcars
both shouting
i’m sure he’s going to stop first!
but there’s no need to worry.
everything
is just as my father wants it to be,
and in due time,
when the fire is burning nicely,
he whisks the newspaper clear,
folds it under his arm,
and picks up the dustpan
with the debris of the night before.
has he just spoken to me again?
i do not think so. i
do not know.
i was thinking how neat he is.
i was asking myself:
will i be like this? how will i manage?
after that he chooses a log
from the wicker wood-basket
to balance on the coals,
and admires his handiwork.
when the time comes to follow him,
glide, glide over the polished floor,
he leads the way to the dustbins.
a breath of ash
pours continuously over his shoulder
from the pan he carries before him
like a man bearing a gift
in a picture of a man bearing a gift.

in my little room, the emperor removes
his robe and we chat
about the mechanics of winning
an election.
“i came, i saw, i conquered,” he says.
when the moon comes out above the
dilapidated warehouse, he asks me
the profundity of going to the moon
and back again to the same ghetto room.
if it pleases your majesty, i say,
the gods make the ghettos.
“i am king,” says the emperor, “i shall
have no gods.”
and he shakes, nearly spilling his oolong tea.
when he has calmed down enough, i
drop two lumps of sugar into his cup.
he marvels at my calculus book and integration
theory and digital watch.
“had i one of those,” he says, “i would have timed
my crossing of the rubicon at eighteen,
and what barbarian woman would not have given herself
for that!”
he yawns imperially over
my utensils, books, and cot
and asks me to cross the rubicon with him.
and i nod while doing tax equations for his majesty
because the hour is late.
he is delighted with the hot chocolate
that i make on a hot plate
and, after making a rough estimate of the roaches
on the wall, he sleeps on my cot
as any sovereign would.
i rattle my typewriter like a machine-
gun all night, partly because it is my
habit, and partly to protect my friend,
the emperor. for though he has crossed
the rubicon with the bravest of men,
he has yet to sleep a single night
in the ghetto.

let them sleep and dream the dream of lobsters;
i am likewise at peace in my little cottage
trying to become mr. five willows.
i figure a crabapple is useful to no one but itself,
but my safety depends on having no place where death can enter
and not acting on every rustling of the smallest branch.
my abode is at the bank of a river, a river that comes
out of the marsh where the river merchant’s wife
has pined for her departed husband for the last 300 years.
beetles fight on a dung heap; that’s the essence of war.
with axes and arrows, a superior force approaches my door;
let them knock lightly, so as not to disturb the
bird in the cage, which i am coaxing to sing,
while the candle burns to illumine the midnight lore
whose frayed texts drive me to the brink of insanity.
let them all sleep and dream that the god of war
has brought them riches in the shape of gold nuggets
only to find in the morning
an empty store.
you can be in my dreams
if i can be in yours. in any case,
let the chinese mafia sleep tonight
so i can be at peace
and in the morning, open wide my door.

the goldfish in my bowl
turns into a carp each night.
swimming in circles in the day,
regal, admired by emperors,
but each night, while i sleep,
it turns into silver, a dagger
cold and sharp, couched at one spot,
enough to frighten cats.
the rest of the furniture
squats in the cold and dark,
complains of being a lone man’s
furnishings, and plots a revolt.
i can hear myself snore, but not
their infidelity. sometimes i wake
with a start; silently they move back
into their places.
i have been unpopular with myself,
pacing in my small, square room.
but my uncle said, “even in a palace,
you can but sleep in one room.”
with this i become humble as a simple
preacher, saying, “i have no powers;
they emanate from god.”
with this i sleep soundly,
fish or no fish, dagger or no dagger.
when i wake, my fish is gold,
it pleases me with a trail of bubbles.
my furniture has been loyal all night,
waiting to provide me comfort.
there was no conspiracy against a poor man.
with this i consider myself king.

measure two handfuls for a prosperous man.
place in pot and wash by rubbing palms together
as if you can’t quite get yourself to pray, or
by squeezing it in one fist. wash
several times to get rid of the cloudy water;
when you are too high in heaven, looking down
at the clouds, you can’t see what’s precious below.
rinse with cold water and keep enough so that
it will barely cover your hand placed on the rice.
don’t use hot water, there are metallic diseases
colliding in it. this method of measuring water will work
regardless of the size of the pot; if the pot is large,
use both hands palms down as if to pat your own belly.
now place on high heat without cover and cook
until the water has been boiled away except in craters
resembling those of the moon, important
in ancient times for growing rice. now place lid on top
and reduce heat to medium, go read your newspaper
until you get to the comics, then come back and turn it down to low.
the heat has been gradually traveling from the outside
to the inside of the rice, giving it texture;
a similar thing happens with people, i suppose.
go back to your newspaper, finish the comics, and read
the financial page. now the rice is done, but before
you eat, consider the peasant who arcs in leech-infested
paddies and who carefully plants the rice seedlings
one by one; on this night, you are eating better than he.
if you still don’t know how to cook rice, buy a japanese
automatic rice cooker; it makes perfect rice every time!

i don’t recall when i first understood
why you stiffen at the roar of low flying jets—
did you tell me, mother, or did i just know?
when you refused to show me the caves like eyes
in the hills behind bah-chan’s house—
did i only dream it, how when the sirens began the trains stopped
dead in their tracks, unleashing a stream of thousands to rush
blind and headlong toward those sheltering hills—
the damp press of strange bodies in darkness
rank with the stench of war’s leavings,
only imagine a young girl’s cries drowned in the tumult,
urgent groping of unseen hands—
the bombs raining d0wn on yokohama harbor all through
the night, hothouse blooms crackling in a seething sky,
then hissing into a boiling sea—
was it a millennium that passed before the sirens ceased their wailing,
only to be taken up again by the dogs and the dying?
but you talk of none of this today. we walk slowly,
saying little, as if less said will keep the heat at bay.
the air is wet, heavy with summer smells
carried aloft on the hypnotic drone of cicadas.
you show me where as a girl you played in other summers,
catching kabuto beetles and dragonflies in bamboo cages.
what must go through you when we pass them
at a distance, those black maws yawning out of the hillside,
exhaling the unspeakable?

when emperor hirohito announced
japan’s defeat over national radio,
his divinity was broken, fell away
and settled in fine gold dust at his feet.
his people understood the gravity
of the occasion—a god does not speak
over the airwaves with a human voice,
ordinary and flecked with static. a god
does not speak in the common voice
of the earthbound, thick with shame.
at the station, my mother, a schoolgirl,
looked on as men in uniform lurched
from the platform into the path
of incoming trains, their slack bodies
landing on the tracks without sound.

near dusk i find her in a newly mown field, lying still
and face down in the coarse stubble. her arms
are splayed out on either side of her body, palms open
and turned upward like two lilies, the slender fingers
gently curling, as if holding onto something. her legs
are drawn up underneath her, as if she fell asleep there
on her knees, perhaps while praying, perhaps intoxicated
by the sweet liquid odor of sheared grass.
her small ankles, white and unscarred, are crossed
one on top of the other, as if arranged so in ritual fashion.
her feet are bare. i cannot see her face, turned
toward the ground as it is,
but her long black hair is lovelier than i remember it,
spilling across her back and down onto the felled stalks
like a pour of glossy tar. her flesh is smooth
and cool, slightly resistant to my touch.
i begin to look around me for something with which
to carry her back—carry her back, i hear myself say,
as if the words spoken aloud, even in a dream,
will somehow make it possible.
i am alone in a field, at dusk, the light leaving
the way it has to, leaking away the way it has to
behind a ridge of swiftly blackening hills. i lie down
on the ground beside my mother under falling darkness
and draw my coat over our bodies. we sleep there like that.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
near the end of my searching
i came to a door.
entering, i found the story
of her life, laid out like a cake
on an ebony table, as if waiting there
for the lost bride—pages flat
and placid, blank as a lake
asleep in winter. hoping
for answers, some knowledge of her,
perhaps—i’m not sure what—
i placed my palm upon the surface.
it sank through and disappeared
beneath a cloud of snowy powder.

i remember them saying,
these poems, their something
for someone at sometime
for me too, at one time. that got in the way;
so i sent them away
back into history—
just temporarily. they won’t come back now.
i can’t remember how
the words spoke, or what
they said,
except:
we are all dead

for the centenary of girton collegei hyphen (gk. together, in one)
a short dash or line used to connect
two words together as a compound
1869-
1969
to connect chapel wing and library.
but also: to divide
for etymological or other purpose.
a gap in stone makes actual
the paradox of a centenary.
“it was a hyphen connecting different races.”
and to the library
“a bridge for migrations”.
in search of an etymology
for compound lives,
this architecture,
an exercise in paleography
(victorian gothic)
asserts the same intention.
portraits busts and books
the “context in which we occur”
that teaches us our meaning,
ignore the lacunae
of a century
in their state-
ment of our need to hyphenate.

homage to william empsonit is the sense, it is the sense, controls,
landing every poem like a fish.
unhuman forms must not assert their roles. glittering scales require the deadly tolls
of net and knife. scales fall to relish.
it is the sense, it is the sense, controls. yet languages are apt to miss on souls
if reason only guts them. applying the wish,
unhuman forms must not assert their roles, ignores the fact that poems have two poles
that must be opposite. hard then to finish
it is the sense, it is the sense, controls, without a sense of lining up for doles
from other kitchens that give us the garnish:
unhuman forms must not assert their roles. and this (forgive me) is like carrying coals
to sheffield. irrelevance betrays a formal anguish.
it is the sense, it is the sense, controls,
“unhuman forms must not assert their roles”.

all day we packed boxes.
we read birth and death certificates.
the yellowed telegrams that announced
our births, the cards of congratulations
and condolences, the deeds and debts,
love letters, valentines with a heart
ripped out, the obituaries.
we opened the divorce decree,
a terrible document of division and subtraction.
we leafed through scrapbooks:
corsages, matchbooks, programs to the ballet,
racetrack, theatre—joy and frivolity
parceled in one volume—
painstakingly arranged, preserved
and pasted with crusted glue.
we sat in the room in which the beloved
had departed. we remembered her yellow hair
and her mind free of paradox.
we sat together side by side
on the empty floor and did not speak.
there were no words
between us other than the essence
of the words from the correspondences,
our inheritance—plain speak,
bereft of poetry.

at the high school football game, the boys
stroke their new muscles, the girls sweeten their lips
with gloss that smells of bubblegum, candy cane,
or cinnamon. in pleated cheerleader skirts
they walk home with each other, practicing yells,
their long bare legs forming in the dark.
under the arched field lights a girl
in a velvet prom dress stands near the chainlink,
a cone of roses held between her breasts.
her lanky father, in a corduroy suit, leans
against the fence. while they talk, she slips a foot
in and out of a new white pump, fingers the weave
of her french braid, the glittering earrings.
they could be a couple on their first date, she,
a little shy, he, trying to impress her
with his casual stance. this is the moment
when she learns what she will love: a warm night,
the feel of nylon between her thighs, the fine hairs
on her arms lifting when a breeze
sifts in through the bleachers, cars
igniting their engines, a man bending over her,
smelling the flowers pressed against her neck.

you will leave your home:
nothing will hold you.
you will wear dresses of gold; skins
of silver, copper, and bronze.
the sky above you will shift in meaning
each time you think you understand.
you will spend a lifetime chipping away layers
of flesh. the shadow of your scales
will always remain. you will be marked
by sulphur and salt.
you will bathe endlessly in clear streams and fail
to rid yourself of that scent.
your feet will never be your own.
stone will be your path.
storms will follow in your wake,
destroying all those who take you in.
you will desert your children
kill your lovers and devour their flesh.
you will love no one
but the wind and ache of your bones.
neither will love you in return.
with age, your hair will grow matted and dull,
your skin will gape and hang in long folds,
your eyes will cease to shine.
but nothing will be enough.
the sea will never take you back.

of course now children take it for granted but once
we watched boxes on a conveyor belt, sliding by,
magically filled and closed, packed and wrapped.
we couldn't get enough of it, running alongside the machine.
in kindergarten miss haynes walked our class down
stuyvesant avenue, then up prospect street
to the hot dog factory. only the girls got to go
as the boys were too wild.
we stood in line, wiggling with excitement as the man
talked about how they made hot dogs, then he handed us
one, and jan dropped hers, so i broke mine in half.
this was the happiest day of our lives,
children whose mothers didn't drive, and had nowhere
to go but school and home, to be taken to that street
to watch the glittering steel and shining rubber belts moving,
moving meats, readymade. i wish i could talk with jan,
recalling the miracle and thrill of the hot dog factory,
when she was alive, before it all stopped—
bright lights, glistening motors, spinning wheels.

the cat has the chance to make the sunlight
beautiful, to stop it and turn it immediately
into black fur and motion, to take it
as shifting branch and brown feather
into the back of the brain forever.
the cardinal has flown the sun in red
through the oak forest to the lawn.
the finch has caught it in yellow
and taken it among the thorns. by the spider
it has been bound tightly and tied
in an eight-stringed knot.
the sun has been intercepted in its one
basic state and changed to a million varieties
of green stick and tassel. it has been broken
into pieces by glass rings, by mist
over the river. its heat
has been given the board fence for body,
the desert rock for fact. on winter hills
it has been laid down in white like a martyr.
this afternoon we could spread gold scarves
clear across the field and say in truth,
"sun you are silk."
imagine the sun totally isolated,
its brightness shot in continuous streaks straight out
into the black, never arrested,
never once being made light.
someone should take note
of how the earth has saved the sun from oblivion.

i'd search for philippines in history class.
the index named one page, moved on to pierce. the making of america marched past
my enigmatic father's place of birth.
the week he died some man we didn't know
called up. this is his brother, one more shock, phoning for him. "he died three days ago."
the leaden black receiver did not talk.
my uncle never gave his name or town,
we never heard from him. was it a dream?
the earpiece roar dissolved to crackling sounds,
a dial tone erased the philippines.
and yet my world grows huge with maps, crisscrossed,
my history alive with all i've lost.

not, in the saying of you, are you
said. baffled and like a root
stopped by a stone you turn back questioning
the tree you feed. but what the leaves hear
is not what the roots ask. inexhaustibly,
being at one time what was to be said
and at another time what has been said
the saying of you remains the living of you
never to be said. but, enduring,
you change with the change that changes
and yet are not of the changing of any of you.
ever yourself, you are always about
to be yourself in something else ever with me.

many nights while walking home 
after work, from downtown to 
an apartment below a market, 
i’d think of alfred espinas:
“we do not get together to die,
but to live and to improve life.”
sudden changes of weather and
contagious diseases nearly broke
the spirits of many friends that
winter, but charmingly we made 
habits of dancing and sharing
meals in our cramped rooms.
our landlords were thieves and
our bosses were pessimists, yet
we dreamed of a new phase of
civilization, one of kindness and
goodwill. “we need communes,”
oscar exclaimed. silvia argued,
“but islands are corpses, let’s think
instead of syndicates.” mondays 
we’d return to dirty dishes, copy
machines, and dull knives, and 
we spent the next three centuries
doing what we were paid to do.

family, lover, colleague. notions, veneers, nation. teeth of no health insurance. a boom can be a microphone affixed to a pole and not an explosion. shadows, we sweep at them constantly and on the table is chocolate, newspapers, commentary, and vastly different pay stubs. i lean in to you and wish to love you perfectly. suffer, tumble, strive, the right shoes, and vacation. at the table, conference and always pretty, the fixed. shimmer of repulsion or fairy tale of cleavage. i count pleasures like cream, sipping, speaking. i like fashion as well. all the hymns you and i know as his headboard knocks against our wall, the slap when he coughs, our neighbor. the most racist of all positions at the staff meeting is to tell us about your shocking talent if there is a most. a prayer dangles over this bitter. looping coves of sympathy. how to history. my flat speech in variously adopted professional tones. merger of you and me and take whatever you want. her beautiful poetry face. his intellectual arms. i worry about the ferocious place in you while framing it. a person as diversion, a thing beautiful, a small green-blue egg in a spring next and now the field is gendered. have you seen the moment of last light? it means something to me. assuming my gender qualifies your hearing and therefore my speech, you overlap words with mine in what appears to be a neutral manner but your speech acts as solvent. down the hall, high heels as metronome, watched. out of our bodies comes speech as clouds, flag, windsock, bandage. dear—
you could make more money if you wanted to. such as a day of beauty, persuasive levels of caring. for example: doing both brow and lip. are you spending or quiet? let’s go to lunch would mean exchanging speech and then carrying warm food in plastic bags. coherence as my mother sleeps after a complicated surgery. and if i were, would you be generous with me as well? race ran the organization which one. we socialize in this real estate of gerrymandered potlucks. i think there exists silence as a legitimate response and i will say that now. the caring for our souls by old black women in the narrative of a college president, passing. excuse me for not knowing passing. you remember but only after the spine is broken. something in chemistry called suspension equals your ghosts caught in my air. the bronx is horning was a line they wrote where i was educated, teaching. response to migration: the pullback of the form remains as a hum, a tongue.

bend to lift her . . . always heavier than i remember,
because in my mind she is still that seedling bough
i used to cradle in one elbow. her hug is honest,
fierce, forgiving. i think of oregon's coastal pines,
wind-bent even on quiet days; they've grown in ways
the pacific breeze has blown them all their lives.
and how will my daughter grow? last night, i dreamed
of a mid-ocean gale, a howl among writhing waterspouts;
i don't know what it meant, or if it's still distant,
or already here. i know only how i hug my daughter,
my arms grown taut with the thought of that wind.

how to make the slanted stems of the p's and d's, the descending
roundness of the capital m's, the long loops of the f's crossed at the center,
sending it back again and again until each message was the same:
a record of her insistence that the hand return her to the way she was before,
and of all the ways the hand had disobeyed.

everyone burned coal in our neighborhood,
soft coal they called it from the mountains
of western pennsylvania where my father
grew up and fled as soon as he could, where
my welsh cousins dug it down in the dark. the furnace it fed stood in the dank
basement, its many arms upraised
like godzilla or some other monster.
it was my job to pull out clinkers
and carry them to the alley bin. mornings were chilly, frost on windows
etching magic landscapes. i liked
to stand over the hot air registers
the warmth blowing up my skirts.
but the basement scared me at night. the fire glowed like a red eye through
the furnace door and the clinkers fell
loud and the shadows came at me as
mice scampered. the washing machine
was tame but the furnace was always hungry.

the dragonfly at rest on the doorbell—
too weak to ring and glad of it,

thinking it best to observe us quietly

a winged cross, plain, the body straight
as a thermometer, the old glass kind
that could kill us with mercury if our teeth
did not respect its brittle body. slim as an eel
but a solitary glider, a pilot without bombs
or weapons, and wings clear and small as a wish
to see over our heads, to see the whole picture.
and when our gaze grazes over it and moves on,
the dragonfly changes its clothes,
sheds its old skin, shriveled like laundry,

nursery, and my sweeter sister watched me with huge brown eyes to see what i'd do next.

his eyes and obeys, knowing the layers
of hair and underfur will warm him while
he floats on a faith we wish could carry us. the sound of his splashing fades, but not
his joy in being pushed, light as driftwood,
back to the mouth of the den i have seen
carved out beneath the roots of a fallen fir
now packed with snow and lined with leaves
that promise his sleep will be deep. because no dreams wait softly for me,
i open the woodstove and strike a match,
hold the bloom of the flame to kindling
that catches quick as my wish: to be that

the moon, bright portal to glide through
without so much as a shiver, no doubt
about where i'm going, how to get there.

of filters, a universe the flying fox
and glass cats, congo tetras, bristle-nose
pleocostemus all take for granted. yet
the platys, gold and red, persist in leaping

we walked at the edge of the sea, the dog,
still young then, running ahead of us. few people. gulls. a flock of pelicans
circled beyond the swells, then closed
their wings and dropped head-long
into the dazzle of light and sea. you clapped
your hands; the day grew brilliant. later we sat at a small table
with wine and food that tasted of the sea. a perfect day, we said to one another,
so that even when the day ended
and the lights of houses among the hills
came on like a scattering of embers,
we watched it leave without regret. that night, easing myself toward sleep,
i thought how blindly we stumble ahead
with such hope, a light flares briefly—ah, happiness!
then we turn and go on our way again. but happiness, too, goes on its way,
and years from where we were, i lie awake
in the dark and suddenly it returns—
that day by the sea, that happiness, though it is not the same happiness,
not the same darkness.

when one thing is becoming another, when writing is morphing, when the writing of an hour becomes the desire to write at all hours and into the night, fueled on caffeine or wine and desiring instruments of writing; typewriters, even a nib and ink well, and considering all the ways of stretching a space, digital or hard copy; hard copy, an ugly expression for printed matter, and for that matter, printed matter is efficient but lacks beauty. page, a soft and elongated word; page, an extension at the end of my fingers; page, a screen that holds dreams and desires; the page of legal document that bind. the page is a promise. i read all sides, turning the page counterclockwise and turning the page over for what i may have missed.
desire is a stick for scratching words into the dirt and for chiseling stone until the words become solid. the pen is a body, an anatomy, not an earthworm with indecipherable ends; the pen has a head and tail, and inky guts. and the brain of the pen belongs to the maker of marks.
later hours/another hour/late hours/early hours/happy hour/visiting hours.
all the elements of the dying hour surround my laptop, in the dying blades of cut grass and in the dying battery. finches continue their making of a nest of twigs and grasses, but i know the nest is early paper, the raw ingredients and pulp. i know the world is a page turner, a paper globe, and i know that the birds are the great writers of the sky.

some people like to relax
and kick back with their friends
just talking and having a drink which is obviously
highly pleasurable. some people like to be entertained
by music or a movie;
some people like to make some jokes
with people they like,
maybe at a bar
or at someone’s house. some people like to lay around
with another person,
just touching, or to prepare food,
alone or with others
while listening to music
that they feel a particular
affinity for. but sometimes people like to thrust themselves
into the howling wind and snow,
arms tied behind their backs. i prefer to open my mouth wide open knowing what will happen
if i’m just holding my mouth open, ready to respond or yell or whatever seems appropriate. you know, i keep my mouth at the ready to make a lot of noise. and sometimes it becomes filled
with hard packed snow or with sand, sand being more of a problem,
since, you know,
it won’t melt.

up from sleep i woke and stepped 
into the borrowed black robes
all ghost bureaucrats trained 
to redirect dreaming pretend 
we do not like to wear. i drove 
my black car to the stadium 
to sit on stage and be watched 
watching young expectant spirits 
one by one with dread certainty 
pass before me, clouded 
in their names. then listened 
to no one in their speeches say 
you’re welcome for allowing 
us not to tell you it’s already 
too late to learn anything 
or defend whatever accidental 
instrument in us causes 
all these useless thoughts. 
like if you walked for hours 
through the vast black avenues 
of those server farms all of us 
with our endless attention built,
you could almost feel the same 
peaceful disinterest as when 
your parents talking and smoking 
raised their heads for a moment 
to smile and tell you go back 
upstairs and read the book 
you love about myths that explain 
weather and death. now it is 
almost june and they are finally 
the children they always were. 
so more precise than anyone 
has ever had to be, go forget
everything we told you
so you can fix what we kept
destroying by calling the future.

i’m broke again

i appropriated a corporate apology
and saved it
in case something happened
but my end date came
and my vacation days paid out
i bought pills
from the intern i’d hired
on my way out

i texted you

when he called, there were 261 emotions
at play. i thought there were only wistfulness,
humiliation, and mere bitterness left, but lo,
i see now the brilliance in the numbers. 
emotions 75 and 78 made me happy just to know
they existed. i felt less alone, more impervious. 
i was emboldened by the existence of 152. 
though, how was i supposed to accept 9, 14, and 179?
we deserved better, distress and indigence aside. 
something about 260 broke the spell inside me

inside every world there is another world trying to get out,
and there is something in you that would like to discount this world. 
the stars could rise in darkness over heartbreaking coasts, 
and you would not know if you were ruining your life or beginning a real one. 
you could claim professional fondness for the world around you; 
the pictures would dissolve under the paint coming alive,
and you would only feel a phantom skip of the heart, absorbed so in the colors. 
your disbelief is a later novel emerging in the long, long shadow of an earlier one—
is this the great world, which is whatever is the case?
the sustained helplessness you feel in the long emptiness of days is matched
by the new suspiciousness and wrath you wake to each morning. 
isn’t this a relationship with your death, too, to fall in love with your inscrutable life?
your teeth fill with cavities. there is always unearned happiness for some, 
and the criminal feeling of solitude. always, everyone lies about his life.

she died suddenly in midwinter, in the same bed in which her husband died years earlier; it still sagged on his side. her second husband remained in japan with his first family. 
she used to say, what my three girls do when they are on their own is unimaginable to me. 
my mother is the middle daughter, a garden of inaudible tunes. the four of them lived in a mean house in seoul. 
one yellowing picture of my grandmother remains, and her face turns away from the camera, as the rabbit senses the hound; 
she was said to be a solitary eater, an inner thing. what did she promise the world that she wasn’t able to make good on? 
a child who abruptly feels the frontiers of experience assert themselves in her: at the funeral my mother cries so hard she can’t feel her hands for days, 
it explains how she scratches herself raw, meaningless. 
you have always believed these are your themes: fate, the negative pleasures of dipping oneself in acid. 
you think it will rescue you from your simplicity, remarks my mother from the doorway, but art is never the ace in the hole. 
i am not a stupid child. i am not even a child any longer, with her hesitant, then terrible certainty, that loss is tragic, not only pointless. 
when she is lonely, my mother cooks; and when she is happy, she knows to hide it.

how to succeed in torture 
without really trying
1. first things first: 
surprise,
catch your source off balance when he least expects it: at the moment he opens his eyes in the morning
while he shits on the can. 
detain and confine,
quickly, quickly​cut him off from the known. 
plunge your source into the strange, 
the invisible wells gone dry in his bones drained by his eyes
he’s in occupied territory—
he could walk a long time and find nowhere, nothing, nada
no doors, no tunnels, windows 
2. keep it simple: familiar clothing reinforces identity. 
replace the source

into trunk and seed, spill husk
onto the heap where my dreaming
and my loving live.
every day i wake to this.
tracks follow the heavy beasts
back to where they huddle, herd.
hunt: a dance against hunger.
music: feast and fear.
this island becomes us.
trees cap our sky. it rustles with delight
in a voice green as lust. reptiles
drag night from their tails,
live by the dark. a rage of waves
protects the horizon, which we would devour.

a fashionable portrait painter
running upstairs to a woman’s apartment

“all the girls are tid’ly did’ly
all the girls are nice
whether they wear their hair in curls
or —”
at the back of the thoughts to which i permit crystallization
the conception brute
why?
the irresponsibility of the male
leaves woman her superior inferiority.

incidentally with the exhaustion of control
i reach the summit

which goaded by the unavoidable

traversing myself
something in the delirium of night hours
confuses while intensifying sensibility
blurring spatial contours
so aiding elusion of the circumscribed
that the gurgling of a crucified wild beast
comes from so far away
and the foam on the stretched muscles of a mouth
is no part of myself
there is a climax in sensibility
when pain surpassing itself
becomes exotic
and the ego succeeds in unifying the positive and negative poles of sensation
uniting the opposing and resisting forces
in lascivious revelation

i saw a wildness twist through your limbs
and fly off. the river fell, the grasses fell. 
the backs of six drowned cattle
rose to the surface ice—nothing moved.
but a wind touched my ankles when the snow began.
you left that night and we stayed,
our arms braced with weight. what power
there was was over. but i switched on the light
by the porch to see if anything was falling—
and it fell, a few glints in the air,
catching sun although there was no sun,
and the long descent over hours, all night,
seemed like years, and we buried our faces
in what came to rest on the ground
or moved our feet over it, effortless,
as nothing was in our lives, or ever will be.

and from then on fire,
from then on burning hair,
from then on limbs and meat.
invisible bandits, pickpockets
from ten-thousand feet,
faceless, thoughtless, dumb
except for humming,
bandits marked with tiny flags,
controlled from continents away
by children, child bandits
with letter jackets left hanging
in their girlfriends' closets,
child bandits with bibles
thumbed and highlighted,
spear missiles through the sky to kill other children
and the blood of children runs through the streets,
neither seen nor heard, obedient,
simply, like children's blood. ask away: why doesn’t his poetry

the body drenched in metaphor? there’s nothing to see here,

just blood in the sand,
blood in the streets,

the neighborhood a claim on space
involving multiple parties it must be father’s day

and in a certain light 
the sonic continuum of tires against the road 
the sensation of being carried along toward the end of a sentence
after the disappearance of the period air to breathe, water to drink 
the suggestion box is empty 
obsolete equipment piles up in nooks and crannies
this is all wrong, that’s messed up

it’s nick and nora charles and their little dog asta they’re visiting nick’s parents in the suburbs 
he’s on the wagon and trying to keep a low profile 
but of course she brags about him to the local paper 
and soon he’s embroiled in detective work despite himself
there is crime everywhere, even here in the suburbs 
it must be human nature
desperate characters on the loose “yoke yourself to your strongest conviction”
was a piece of advice derived from the y in joy
but pam doesn’t buy that 
and i say it sounds too slavish 
remember the groucho line 
“these are my principles
if you don’t like them i have others” when the pen runs out of ink 
you simply replace the cartridge 
and continue writing 
to the sound of jet planes overhead 
it’s time to revive the typewriter 
for the benefit of kids 
now entering the ranks of the scribe force
sliding the paper under the roller 
striking the surface with heavy metal blows 
history curls right into the future 
a möbius strip 
that brings bygone media around and back 
with all the drama, character, sound, light and destiny
alive in an imagination of living

it’s unbearable to shadow drift along the
seabed. it’s unbearable to grieve when
sleeping is more important. the boat is a hammock without strings.
as the body is a sleeve not strung to the
soul. the boat is chained to the shadow;
when the shadow drifts, the boat drifts
too.is it at sea? or is it just in air? can a
boat live on air alone? the man’s back bleeds. this is all
expected of creatures who sacrifice their
nudity for solitude and immortality. the flesh is eager to float, fully
captivated by the impulse to preserve an
array of stillness. the horizon is not
skirring and nothing can move on that
river made of air. this boat. this boat. this boat that the horizon can’t coat
with its own monolithic entreaty. the man bathes in all blemishes of the
moon. the man’s body can take
imperfection, as he feels complete. his
white-grey hair is a type of condensed
cloud he can rest his head on. if he must
commit suicide, he knows he will rest on
a very comfortable pillow, one that he
grows from the ovoid base of his skull. it’s good to get all the hard work done
first and then unbutton one’s corporeal
flesh calmly before the undiluted
enterprise of air. his penis is one finger pointing to the line
that separates his thighs. everything
is hidden deliciously inside his pituitary
gland.

from the fruitwounds of cherries i plunked into my bucket
and still—he must have seen some small bit of loveliness
in walking his orchard with me. he pointed out which trees
were sweetest, which ones bore double seeds—puffing out
the flesh and oh the surprise on your tongue with two tiny stones
(a twin spit), making a small gun of your mouth. did i mention
my favorite color is red? his jeans were worn and twisty
around the tops of his boot; his hands thick but careful, 
nimble enough to pull fruit from his trees without tearing
the thin skin; the cherry dust and fingerprints on his eyeglasses. 
i just know when he stuffed his hands in his pockets, said okay. couldn't hurt to try? and shuffled back to his roadside stand
to arrange his jelly jars and stacks of buckets, i had made
a terrible mistake. i just know my summer would've been
full of pies, tartlets, turnovers—so much jubilee.

to keep me from staying out late at night, 
my mother warned of the hell pig. black and full
of hot drool, eyes the color of a lung—it'd follow me
home if i stayed past my curfew. how to tell my friends
to press pause in the middle of a video, say their good-byes
while i shuffled up the stairs and into my father's waiting
blue car? how to explain this to my dates, whisper
why we could not finish this dance? it's not like the pig
had any special powers or could take a tiny bite
from my leg—only assurances that it was simply
scandal to be followed home. when my date and i
pull into my driveway and dim the lights, we take
care to make all the small noises that get made
in times like these even smaller: squeaks in the seats, 
a slow spin of the radio dial, the silver click of my belt. 
too late. a single black hair flickers awake the ear
of the dark animal waiting for me at the end of the walk. 
my fumbling of keys and various straps a wild dance
to the door—the pig grunting in tune to each hurried step, each
of his wet breaths puffing into tiny clouds, a small storm brewing.

flour on the floor makes my sandals 
slip and i tumble into your arms. 
too hot to bake this morning but
blueberries begged me to fold them
into moist muffins. sticks of rhubarb 
plotted a whole pie. the windows
are blown open and a thickfruit tang
sneaks through the wire screen
and into the home of the scowly lady
who lives next door. yesterday, a man 
in the city was rescued from his apartment
which was filled with a thousand rats. 
something about being angry because
his pet python refused to eat. he let the bloom 
of fur rise, rise over the little gnarly blue rug, 
over the coffee table, the kitchen countertops
and pip through each cabinet, snip
at the stumpy bags of sugar,
the cylinders of salt. our kitchen is a riot
of pots, wooden spoons, melted butter. 
so be it. maybe all this baking will quiet
the angry voices next door, if only
for a brief whiff. i want our summers
to always be like this—a kitchen wrecked
with love, a table overflowing with baked goods
warming the already warm air. after all the pots
are stacked, the goodies cooled, and all the counters
wiped clean—let us never be rescued from this mess.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
in those days, though, i never analysed
myself even. all analysis comes late.
you catch a sight of nature, earliest,
in full front sun-face, and your eyelids wink
and drop before the wonder of ‘t; you miss
the form, through seeing the light. i lived, those days,
and wrote because i lived–unlicensed else:
my heart beat in my brain. life’s violent flood
abolished bounds,–and, which my neighbour’s field,
which mine, what mattered? it is so in youth.
we play at leap-frog over the god term;
the love within us and the love without
are mixed, confounded; if we are loved or love,
we scarce distinguish. so, with other power.
being acted on and acting seem the same:
in that first onrush of life’s chariot-wheels,
we know not if the forests move or we.
and so, like most young poets, in a flush
of individual life, i poured myself
along the veins of others, and achieved
mere lifeless imitations of life verse,
and made the living answer for the dead,
profaning nature. ‘touch not, do not taste,
nor handle,’–we’re too legal, who write young:
we beat the phorminx till we hurt our thumbs,
as if still ignorant of counterpoint;
we call the muse ... ‘o muse, benignant muse!’–
as if we had seen her purple-braided head.
with the eyes in it start between the boughs
as often as a stag’s. what make-believe,
with so much earnest! what effete results,
from virile efforts! what cold wire-drawn odes
from such white heats!–bucolics, where the cows
would scare the writer if they splashed the mud
in lashing off the flies,–didactics, driven
against the heels of what the master said;
and counterfeiting epics, shrill with trumps
a babe might blow between two straining cheeks
of bubbled rose, to make his mother laugh;
and elegiac griefs, and songs of love,
like cast-off nosegays picked up on the road,
the worse for being warm: all these things, writ
on happy mornings, with a morning heart,
that leaps for love, is active for resolve,
weak for art only. oft, the ancient forms
will thrill, indeed, in carrying the young blood.
the wine-skins, now and then, a little warped,
will crack even, as the new wine gurgles in.
spare the old bottles!–spill not the new wine.
by keats’s soul, the man who never stepped
in gradual progress like another man,
but, turning grandly on his central self,
ensphered himself in twenty perfect years
and died, not young,–(the life of a long life,
distilled to a mere drop, falling like a tear
upon the world’s cold cheek to make it burn
for ever;) by that strong excepted soul,
i count it strange, and hard to understand,
that nearly all young poets should write old;
that pope was sexagenarian at sixteen,
and beardless byron academical,
and so with others. it may be, perhaps,
such have not settled long and deep enough
in trance, to attain to clairvoyance,–and still
the memory mixes with the vision, spoils,
and works it turbid.
or perhaps, again,
in order to discover the muse-sphinx,
the melancholy desert must sweep round,
behind you, as before.–
for me, i wrote
false poems, like the rest, and thought them true.
because myself was true in writing them.
i, peradventure, have writ true ones since
with less complacence.
but i could not hide
my quickening inner life from those at watch.
they saw a light at a window now and then,
they had not set there. who had set it there?
my father’s sister started when she caught
my soul agaze in my eyes. she could not say
i had no business with a sort of soul,
but plainly she objected,–and demurred,
that souls were dangerous things to carry straight
through all the spilt saltpetre of the world.
she said sometimes, ‘aurora, have you done
your task this morning?–have you read that book?
and are you ready for the crochet here?’–
as if she said, ‘i know there’s something wrong,
i know i have not ground you down enough
to flatten and bake you to a wholesome crust
for household uses and proprieties,
before the rain has got into my barn
and set the grains a-sprouting. what, you’re green
with out-door impudence? you almost grow?’
to which i answered, ‘would she hear my task,
and verify my abstract of the book?
and should i sit down to the crochet work?
was such her pleasure?’ ... then i sate and teased
the patient needle til it split the thread,
which oozed off from it in meandering lace
from hour to hour. i was not, therefore, sad;
my soul was singing at a work apart
behind the wall of sense, as safe from harm
as sings the lark when sucked up out of sight,
in vortices of glory and blue air.
and so, through forced work and spontaneous work,
the inner life informed the outer life,
reduced the irregular blood to settled rhythms,
made cool the forehead with fresh-sprinkling dreams,
and, rounding to the spheric soul the thin
pined body, struck a colour up the cheeks,
though somewhat faint. i clenched my brows across
my blue eyes greatening in the looking-glass,
and said, ‘we’ll live, aurora! we’ll be strong.
the dogs are on us–but we will not die.’
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
'there it is!–
you play beside a death-bed like a child,
yet measure to yourself a prophet's place
to teach the living. none of all these things,
can women understand. you generalise,
oh, nothing!–not even grief! your quick-breathed hearts,
so sympathetic to the personal pang,
close on each separate knife-stroke, yielding up
a whole life at each wound; incapable
of deepening, widening a large lap of life
to hold the world-full woe. the human race
to you means, such a child, or such a man,
you saw one morning waiting in the cold,
beside that gate, perhaps. you gather up
a few such cases, and, when strong, sometimes
will write of factories and of slaves, as if
your father were a negro, and your son
a spinner in the mills. all's yours and you,–
all, coloured with your blood, or otherwise
just nothing to you. why, i call you hard
to general suffering. here's the world half blind
with intellectual light, half brutalised
with civilization, having caught the plague
in silks from tarsus, shrieking east and west
along a thousand railroads, mad with pain
and sin too! ... does one woman of you all,
(you who weep easily) grow pale to see
this tiger shake his cage?–does one of you
stand still from dancing, stop from stringing pearls
and pine and die, because of the great sum
of universal anguish?–show me a tear
wet as cordelia's, in eyes bright as yours,
because the world is mad? you cannot count,
that you should weep for this account, not you!
you weep for what you know. a red-haired child
sick in a fever, if you touch him once,
though but so little as with a finger-tip,
will set you weeping! but a million sick . .
you could as soon weep for the rule of three,
or compound fractions. therefore, this same world
uncomprehended by you must remain
uninfluenced by you. women as you are,
mere women, personal and passionate,
you give us doating mothers, and chaste wives.
sublime madonnas, and enduring saints!
we get no christ from you,–and verily
we shall not get a poet, in my mind.'
'with which conclusion you conclude' . .
'but this–
that you, aurora, with the large live brow
and steady eyelids, cannot condescend
to play at art, as children play at swords,
to show a pretty spirit, chiefly admired
because true action is impossible.
you never can be satisfied with praise
which men give women when they judge a book
not as mere work, but as mere woman's work,
expressing the comparative respect
which means the absolute scorn. 'oh, excellent!
'what grace! what facile turns! what fluent sweeps!
'what delicate discernment ... almost thought!
'the book does honour to the sex, we hold.
'among our female authors we make room
'for this fair writer, and congratulate
'the country that produces in these times
'such women, competent to ... spell.''
'stop there!'
i answered–burning through his thread of talk
with a quick flame of emotion,–'you have read
my soul, if not my book, and argue well
i would not condescend ... we will not say
to such a kind of praise, (a worthless end
is praise of all kinds) but to such a use
of holy art and golden life. i am young,
and peradventure weak–you tell me so–
through being a woman. and, for all the rest,
take thanks for justice. i would rather dance
at fairs on tight-rope, till the babies dropped
their gingerbread for joy,–than shift the types
for tolerable verse, intolerable
to men who act and suffer. better far,
pursue a frivolous trade by serious means,
than a sublime art frivolously.'
then i spoke.
'i have not stood long on the strand of life,
and these salt waters have had scarcely time
to creep so high up as to wet my feet.
i cannot judge these tides–i shall, perhaps.
a woman's always younger than a man
at equal years, because she is disallowed
maturing by the outdoor sun and air,
and kept in long-clothes past the age to walk.
ah well, i know you men judge otherwise!
you think a woman ripens as a peach,–
in the cheeks, chiefly. pass it to me now;
i'm young in age, and younger still, i think,
as a woman. but a child may say amen
to a bishop's prayer and see the way it goes;
and i, incapable to loose the knot
of social questions, can approve, applaud
august compassion, christian thoughts that shoot
beyond the vulgar white of personal aims.
accept my reverence.'
there he glowed on me
with all his face and eyes. 'no other help?'
said he–'no more than so?'
'what help?' i asked.
'you'd scorn my help,–as nature's self, you say,
has scorned to put her music in my mouth,
because a woman's. do you now turn round
and ask for what a woman cannot give?'
'for what she only can, i turn and ask,'
he answered, catching up my hands in his,
and dropping on me from his high-eaved brow
the full weight of his soul,–'i ask for love,
and that, she can; for life in fellowship
through bitter duties–that, i know she can;
for wifehood ... will she?'
'now,' i said, 'may god
be witness 'twixt us two!' and with the word,
me seemed i floated into a sudden light
above his stature,–'am i proved too weak
to stand alone, yet strong enough to bear
such leaners on my shoulder? poor to think,
yet rich enough to sympathise with thought?
incompetent to sing, as blackbirds can,
yet competent to love, like him?'
i paused:
perhaps i darkened, as the lighthouse will
that turns upon the sea. 'it's always so!
anything does for a wife.'
'aurora, dear,
and dearly honoured' ... he pressed in at once
with eager utterance,–'you translate me ill.
i do not contradict my thought of you
which is most reverent, with another thought
found less so. if your sex is weak for art,
(and i who said so, did but honour you
by using truth in courtship) it is strong
for life and duty. place your fecund heart
in mine, and let us blossom for the world
that wants love's colour in the grey of time.
with all my talk i can but set you where
you look down coldly on the arena-heaps
of headless bodies, shapeless, indistinct!
the judgment-angel scarce would find his way
through such a heap of generalised distress,
to the individual man with lips and eyes–
much less aurora. ah, my sweet, come down,
and, hand in hand, we'll go where yours shall touch
these victims, one by one! till one by one,
the formless, nameless trunk of every man
shall seem to wear a head, with hair you know,
and every woman catch your mother's face
to melt you into passion.'
'i am a girl,'
i answered slowly; 'you do well to name
my mother's face. though far too early, alas,
god's hand did interpose 'twixt it and me,
i know so much of love, as used to shine
in that face and another. just so much;
no more indeed at all. i have not seen
so much love since, i pray you pardon me,
as answers even to make a marriage with,
in this cold land of england. what you love,
is not a woman, romney, but a cause:
you want a helpmate, not a mistress, sir,–
a wife to help your ends ... in her no end!
your cause is noble, your ends excellent,
but i, being most unworthy of these and that,
do otherwise conceive of love. farewell.'
'farewell, aurora, you reject me thus?'
he said.
'why, sir, you are married long ago.
you have a wife already whom you love,
your social theory. bless you both, i say.
for my part, i am scarcely meek enough
to be the handmaid of a lawful spouse.
do i look a hagar, think you?'
'so, you jest!'
'nay so, i speak in earnest,' i replied.
'you treat of marriage too much like, at least,
a chief apostle; you would bear with you
a wife ... a sister ... shall we speak it out?
a sister of charity.'
'then, must it be
indeed farewell? and was i so far wrong
in hope and in illusion, when i took
the woman to be nobler than the man,
yourself the noblest woman,–in the use
and comprehension of what love is,–love,
that generates the likeness of itself
through all heroic duties? so far wrong
in saying bluntly, venturing truth on love,
'come, human creature, love and work with me,'–
instead of, 'lady, thou art wondrous fair,
'and, where the graces walk before, the muse
'will follow at the lighting of the eyes,
'and where the muse walks, lovers need to creep
'turn round and love me, or i die of love.''
with quiet indignation i broke in.
'you misconceive the question like a man,
who sees a woman as the complement
of his sex merely. you forget too much
that every creature, female as the male,
stands single in responsible act and thought
as also in birth and death. whoever says
to a loyal woman, 'love and work with me,'
will get fair answers, if the work and love
being good themselves, are good for her–the best
she was born for. women of a softer mood,
surprised by men when scarcely awake to life,
will sometimes only hear the first word, love,
and catch up with it any kind of work,
indifferent, so that dear love go with it:
i do not blame such women, though, for love,
they pick much oakum; earth's fanatics make
too frequently heaven's saints. but me, your work
is not the best for,–nor your love the best,
nor able to commend the kind of work
for love's sake merely. ah, you force me, sir,
to be over-bold in speaking of myself,–
i, too, have my vocation,–work to do,
the heavens and earth have set me, since i changed
my father's face for theirs,–and though your world
were twice as wretched as you represent
most serious work, most necessary work,
as any of the economists'. reform,
make trade a christian possibility,
and individual right no general wrong;
wipe out earth's furrows of the thine and mine,
and leave one green, for men to play at bowls;
with innings for them all! ... what then, indeed,
if mortals were not greater by the head
than any of their prosperities? what then,
unless the artist keep up open roads
betwixt the seen and unseen,–bursting through
the best of your conventions with his best
the unspeakable, imaginable best
god bids him speak, to prove what lies beyond
both speech and imagination? a starved man
exceeds a fat beast: we'll not barter, sir,
the beautiful for barley.–and, even so,
i hold you will not compass your poor ends
of barley-feeding and material ease,
without a poet's individualism
to work your universal. it takes a soul,
to move a body: it takes a high-souled man,
to move the masses ... even to a cleaner stye:
it takes the ideal, to blow a hair's breadth off
the dust of the actual.–ah, your fouriers failed,
because not poets enough to understand
that life develops from within.–for me,
perhaps i am not worthy, as you say,
of work like this! ... perhaps a woman's soul
aspires, and not creates! yet we aspire,
and yet i'll try out your perhapses, sir;
and if i fail ... why, burn me up my straw
like other false works–i'll not ask for grace,
your scorn is better, cousin romney. i
who love my art, would never wish it lower
to suit my stature. i may love my art,
you'll grant that even a woman may love art,
seeing that to waste true love on anything,
is womanly, past question.'

on the side of the road a deer, frozen, frigid. go back to your life, the voice said. what is my life? she wondered. for months she lost
herself in work—freud said work is as important
as love to the soul—and at night she sat with a boy,
forcing him to practice his violin, helping him recite his notes.
then the ice thawed and the deer came to life.
she saw her jump over the fence, she saw her in the twilight,
how free she looked. she saw her eyes shiny as marbles,
as much a part of this world as the fence a worker
pounds into the earth. at night she still sat with the boy.
he’s learning “au claire de la lune.”
do you know it? he has established a relationship
with his violin. he knows that it takes practice to master it:
the accuracy of each note, to wrestle his feelings to the listener.
but he’s impatient. sometimes what he hears and feels
are not always the same. again, the poet says.
she knows if he tries to silence his fervor, he might not ever know
who he is. the poet contemplates whether a deer can dream.

for its prudence, but i love the romantic
who submits finally to sex in a burning row-house more. that’s why nothing’s more romantic
than working your teeth through
the muscle. nothing’s more romantic than the way good love can take leave of you.
that’s why i’m so doggone lonesome, baby,

did your father come home after fighting
through the week at work? did the sweat change
to salt in his ears? was that bitter whitegrain the only music he’d hear? is this why
you were quiet when other poets sang
of the black man’s beauty? is this why you choked on the tonsil of negro duty?
were there as many offices for pain
as love? should a black man never be shy? was your father a mountain twenty
shovels couldn’t bury? was he a train
leaving a lone column of smoke? was he a black magnolia singing at your feet?
was he a blackjack smashed against your throat?

"in spite of everything i shall rise again: i will take up my pencil, which i have forsaken in my great discouragement, and i will go on with my drawing."—vincent van gogh
a missile is shaped like a pencil—
its long, slender body and pointed
end creates history. a girl walking down the street
a few steps ahead of her sister and friend,
two medics who were trying to help
injured people, the parked ambulance—
all were annihilated by the same weapon. above, drones—silent, unmanned planes.
a metal, predatory bird that shoots a missile
with precision, identifying the colors of a shirt,
the features on a face—the shape of a nose,
the color and length of a mustache.in a room far away, in another country, a man
sits at a desk and looks at a screen; he strokes
his thick, dark mustache as he carefully
contemplates, then pushes a button. there is a charred hole in the ground
where the girl once stood. there are pencils that write and erase,
write and erase, so that there is nothing
to be read on the page. the page blank
as the desert sky, blank as the smooth shell of a drone. there is a family drinking mint tea
in a living room.
the man holds a cup to his lips,
the glass touches his mustache.
a silent bird hovers above.
in a split second, everyone is dead,
the house is in rubbles—arms, legs,
splattered organs among broken concrete. soon, there will be no trace.

what we so freely eliminate. who is not guilty of it? we reek of paper.
everywhere we go is paper. our hands are stained with paper.
walls. what echoes from our walls. the sweet whisper of rainforest—
even the name makes the sound of rushing water or perhaps it’s a ghost
that haunts us. they say the dead that did not die a peaceful death are
doomed forever to wander the earth. but perhaps this earth is for them
already a cemetery—stacks and stacks of flesh on a desk. which
one belongs to which tree? already, we’ve traded oxygen for
so much.

i am tired of having five different names;-
having to change them when i enter a new country or take on a new life. my
first name is my truest, i suppose, but I never use it and nobody calls me by this vietnamese
name though it is on my birth certificate—tue my chuc. it makes the sound of a twang of a
string pulled. my parents tell me my name in cantoneseis chuc mei wai. three soft bird chirps and they call
me ah wai. shortly after i moved to the u.s., i became teresa my chuc, then teresa mei chuc. “teresa” is the sound
water makes when one is washing one’s hands. after my first marriage, my name was teresa chuc prokopiev.
after my second marriage, my name was teresa chuc dowell. now i am back to teresa mei chuc, but i want to go way back.
reclaim that name once given and lost so quickly in its attempt to become someone that would fit in. who is tue my chuc?
i don’t really know. i was never really her and her birthday on march 16, i never celebrate because it’s not my real birthday
though it is on my birth certificate. my birthday is on january 26, really, but i have to pretend that it’s on march 16
because my mother was late registering me after the war. or it’s in december, the date changing every year according to
the lunar calendar—this is the one my parents celebrate because it’s my chinese birthday. all these names
and birthdays make me dizzy. sometimes i just don’t feel like a teresa anymore; tue (pronounced twe) isn’t so embarrassing.
a fruit learns to love its juice. anyways, i’d like to be string...resonating. pulled back tensely like a bow then reverberate in the arrow’s release straight for the heart.
<|endoftext|>

is it you on the other end of the line
hesitant to speak to me, pausing for a moment
to register my hello so you know my number
stayed the same, my last name remains mine?
though my voice isn’t young as when we last spoke,
don’t you hear a familiar timbre?
still you hesitate so as not to startle me
after all this time. dots string out like an ellipsis
in the endless sentence of your absence.
i hear static-filled ticking, then
a friendly stranger mispronounces my name.
recognizing a pitch to sell something
and feeling foolish, i hang up quickly.
won’t you ever break your long silence?
sorrow and anger keep my line open to you.

come home, our sons, young drivers,
tell us you’re safe, not detained again
by police for your dark color,
sprocketed hair and a crime
you didn’t commit.
maybe your car’s the wrong make
or rusty in a neighborhood
where cars park in garages at night. once, when you saw a squad car
you remembered officer smiley
and his dog that did tricks
in read-aloud books at j.j. hill school.
now, as you reach for your license
with shaking hands, tension raises
the chance something will go wrong. this poem is for you, sons,
and for everyone who is afraid—
citizens of police, police of citizens.
it’s for philando castile,
a black school lunch supervisor
in an inner city school
who memorized children’s names
and their food allergies.
and it’s for the policeman
who stopped a car with a damaged taillight.
after he used his gun, his voice broke
like a frightened child’s. come home, sons, to mothers like me,
alert at night waiting for car lights
to beam in front of our house,
for the car to belong to our sons,
and our sons
to still belong to the world.

this sets routines on haywire. like a domestic goat staked
to its circle of earth.
i don’t do well untethered. i have no hunger for early dinner,
become confused by the sound
of children who seem out too late for a school night.
they’ve found an extra helping
of daylight to romp on new grass and can’t contain themselves,
strip off jackets, scatter
like a rag of ponies. whatever time says,
their joy insists
on springing forward.

weeks after ice-out,
last fall’s leaves
make a pathway
to the lake, radiant blue
and still deathly cold. i press my hot forehead
to the window,
smudging it. blow
and the glass steams.
as if looking at a photo
through parchment,
i’m detached,
the way i saw his body
in the cat scan
from a foggy distance. i’d like to open the window,
release a wounded bird
nursed to health.
wiping the glass
with my sleeve
i see white pelicans
wheel and flash in the sky.

it's hard to be humble when you're 235 pounds of twisted steel and sex appeal with a body women love and men fear. —sputnik Monroe when my father died, he left me a trove
of video tapes, a warped memorial
for those men he watched with my mother
before she left for parts unknown,
for those fights he relived once he was laid
off from the plane yards. we watched
men like sputnik monroe bleed the hard way,
shook our fists as he broke rules
against guys who were easier to cheer.
he was a bad elvis, greased-back
hair with a shock of white, sputnik monroe
mixed it up everywhere, a rodeo
fistfight, a henhouse tornado. my mother
picked a fight in an idaho truck stop
once, stabbed a man’s chest with her middle
finger, then stepped to one side
so my father could fight him in the parking lot.
afterwards, my mother was silent
all the way back to seattle, her disgust
with him—the way he wrapped his arm
around her shoulder, guided her to the car,
and sped back to the freeway—hanging
between them from that point forward.
sputnik monroe clobbered men
wherever he went, sneered at those fists
raised against him in memphis.
some nights, as my wife sleeps upstairs,
i watch my father’s video tapes and
imagine what i would have done that day
if i knew that my marriage depended
on what i did with my hands.

after the dinosaurs fell
asleep, after those terrible lizards
began their slow decay into mythology,
andre the giant was there to cradle
their bodies in his soft hands and weep.24.
andre the giant wrestled the earth
into a globe, carved his name into the ocean
floor with his pinky to remind the whales
who taught them to sing.32.
andre the giant was a village.
then he became a dragon.
then he became an army.
then he became a king.
now, he is the wind.40.
a man can’t bodyslam andre the giant
unless he’s worthy of slaying a monster, unless
the giant decides it’s time to lie down.58.
andre the giant stole fire from heaven,
hid it in his mouth, fed it to monkeys
one lick at a time until they learned
to pronounce his name.67.
before there were boys with magic
beanstalks, with slingshots or singing
swords, andre the giant brawled
with sooty angels, volcanoes spouting
from where he buried their hearts75. 
andre the giant scaled the empire
state building with marilyn monroe
in one hand, cleopatra in the other.
they marveled at how small we are.81.
andre the giant once cracked the sky’s ribs.
then he was thunder churning like trout.
then he was an avalanche of fists and knees.
then he was a fire burning through the forest.
then he was a tidal wave seething offshore.
now, he will not be a metaphor.93.
when andre the giant pitched a man
over the top rope and out into the crowd,
he aimed at the moon.100.
a man never tells a lie, always treats a promise
like his mother’s name. andre the giant
once threw a silver dollar across the potomac,
hit a buffalo in the eye and killed it as it grazed.116.
andre the giant drank three bottles of whiskey
and grappled with the devil in a bingo hall
in memphis. then he invented the blues.125.
on television, andre the giant grinned
with a mouthful of shark’s teeth. he devoured
mortal men ten-at-a-time, laughed and spit
their bones into our living rooms.137.
andre the giant was a frenchman.
then he became an ogre.
then he became a movie star.
now, he is the constellations.
all of them.

a man can stand with both feet touching
the ground until his legs no longer reach
that far, until the ground disappears.2.
giant baba stands six feet ten inches tall, taller
in japan. it doesn’t matter how tall you are.
a man can hold a woman, can’t stand to lose
her to the heart’s wreckage. his body will fall
apart one day—a rock crab’s chassis stripped
clean by seagulls, a dandelion gone to seed.4.
giant baba stands over seven feet tall.
when he lifts you over his head, you will be
eight and a half feet above the ground.5.
a man can stand for anything when seen
from below—fatherhood, majesty, satisfaction
after conquest. in the end all men are seen
from above—patch of lawn, chunk of stone.6.
giant baba towers above your house,
dangles you by the ankle. your life
looks so small from the sky.7.
a man and a woman can wrestle together
in the same bed. a man and a woman
and a marriage can brawl all night.8.
giant baba looms dark against the stars, back
blotting out the milky way, arms cradling you
and your family history. listen to his mammoth
heartbeat, war drum, earthquake. just listen.9.
a man can stand naked in a foreign country,
can search for meaning in strange tongues. he tries
to find himself in stories about famous battles,
about giants. it doesn’t matter where he stands.10.
giant baba’s body is made of girders
and mastodon bones. when you stand outside
to look at your house from new angles,
when you think of how your father died,
the giant will be there to catch you.

given over to love,
she un-balls the socks, lets fall debris of days,

exasperated moan bounced off the quaint speckled enamel
of the top loader vowing: she'd do this always and well.

i've become the person who says darling, who says sugarpie,
honeybunch, snugglebear—and that’s just for my children.
what i call my husband is unprintable. you’re welcome. i am
his sweetheart, and finally, finally—i answer to his call and his
alone. animals are named for people, places, or perhaps a little
latin. plants invite names for colors or plant-parts. when you
get a group of heartbeats together you get names that call out
into the evening’s first radiance of planets: a quiver of cobras,
a maelstrom of salamanders, an audience of squid, or an ostentation
of peacocks. but what is it called when creatures on this earth curl
and sleep, when shadows of moons we don’t yet know brush across
our faces? and what is the name for the movement we make when
we wake, swiping hand or claw or wing across our face, like trying
to remember a path or a river we’ve only visited in our dreams.

swear words pressed to wax—i can’t even look him
in the eye when i ask him to give it a good listen
with me. but he does, ever patient, and we both get
a light bless of sweat on, a bright address that still maps
us to each other after all this time. when i read him the lyrics, the pink of my cheeks is like the pink of an orchid mantis. just when you least expect it,
the pretend flower will reach out and snatch a butterfly
from the air. when i say flower i mean how her song
blooms in the cicada-electric mississippi night. when i say pink i mean nectar i mean a long kiss good and sweet.

breathe deep even if it means you wrinkle
your nose from the fake-lemon antiseptic
of the mopped floors and wiped-down
doorknobs. the freshly soaped necks
and armpits. your teacher means well,
even if he butchers your name like
he has a bloody sausage casing stuck
between his teeth, handprints
on his white, sloppy apron. and when
everyone turns around to check out
your face, no need to fush red and warm.
just picture all the eyes as if your classroom
is one big scallop with its dozens of icy blues
and you will remember that winter your family took you to the china sea and you sank
your face in it to gaze at baby clams and sea stars the size of your outstretched hand. and when
all those necks start to crane, try not to forget someone once lathered their bodies, once patted them
dry with a fluffy towel after a bath, set out their clothes for the first day of school. think of their pencil cases
from third grade, full of sharp pencils, a pink pearl eraser. think of their handheld pencil sharpener and its tiny blade.

an antelope would not exist.
an ape would be unknown.

say “afraid” or “all alone”.
the a’s in avocado
would completely disappear
and certain words would be forgot
like “ankle”, “arm”, and “ear”. without the a, you couldn’t aim
an arrow in the air.
you wouldn’t ask for apricots
or almonds at a fair.
aruba and australia
would be missing from a map.
you’d never use an atm,
an apron, or an app.
the arctic fox and aardvark
would be absent from the zoo,

face, her wind-burned cheeks red as cherries.
her father waits by the curb, ready to rescue
his child should danger threaten, his shadow
reaching halfway across the yard. i take the
booklet from the girl's outstretched hand,
peruse the color photos of candy bars and
caramel-coated popcorn, pretend to read it.
i have no use for what she's selling, but i
can count the freckles on her nose, the scars
like fat worms on knobby knees that ought
to be covered on a cold day like this, when
the wind is blowing and the trees are losing
their grip on the last of their leaves. i'll take two of these and one of those, i say, pointing,
thinking i won't eat them, but i probably will.
it's worth the coming calories to see her joy,
how hard she works to spell my name right,
taking down my information. then she turns
and gives a thumbs-up sign to her father, who
grins like an outfielder to whom the ball has
finally come—his heart like a glove, opening.

4but you had the sense that he was always competing with your father for your affection. not only my father. he didn’t understand my need to develop ties in these new worlds. he tried to legislate over my feelings. he was subject to extraordinarily inappropriate fits of jealousy.
how are you the judge of that? many small incidents.
such as… the boy’s name was warren. he was an orphan.
as we pulled into the weed lot of the camp
in the uncertain march air and patented silence,
i could see him peeking down at us
from a second story dormer window,
like someone who had been dreaming of escape
from the run-down resort: torn up turf; dirt
basketball court, net hanging for its life by one
thin strand of rope; horseshoes, shuffle board;
musty, mildewed cabins with wet bedding;
the stars pressing too hard against our faces
in the catastrophic silence of the nights…
i’d never been left so happily alone,
alone, that is, in warren’s wonderful company.
his talk mimicked the cadence of the stones he kicked.
warren showed me the mica glow in the arrowheads
and quartz-tipped spears he'd unearthed.
warren's cigar box overflowed with other people's
souvenirs, miniature monuments, key chains, lighters,
and initialed items like cuff links and bracelets.
he scoured the corners of the rooms of the departed
while his “mother,” slip of the tongue there, vacuumed.
“people always leave something behind,” he said.
i knew what he meant: taking their clothes
on and off so many times something
had to go. i wanted an initial bracelet
even with someone else’s initials.
the kids at summer camp in the poconos all had
initialed bracelets, except for me,
but who among them had been west
of the mississippi?
warren wanted a home. i didn’t know what i wanted.
i asked to bring warren home and give him a home.
“that’s ridiculous, he has a home here.
besides, you only just met.”
my mother lamented his stick-thin, soot-blackened frame,
the smell he gave off and his yellow teeth,
his urchin eating with his hands,
his short and choppy hair,
his blousy shirt and baggy fatigues
that gave him a bulk, a volume,
he didn’t otherwise possess.
what about his fits of giddy delight?
as the days passed i forgot myself.
i became more and more like warren.
i would brook no insults about my brother.
it would no longer be me, but me and warren.
i’d share my meals with warren, and my desk at school.
warren could stay and i would just—slip away.
next to warren, i felt like i was on a clipper ship
lifted out of the water by the powerful wind-breath
of my two distant coastal families; my warring
mother and “blood” father, her lovely
companionable family in los angeles and manhattan;
his friendly, compliant relations in manhattan and bensonhurst…
i dreamt both families were jammed on the deck
of the ship, waving, gesticulating, shouting,
and that i clung to a raft’s rope as a great
wave flung me back and back, but the truth
was i wasn’t sure i wanted to be near.
i wanted to fly apart—in the nowhere—.
when our two-door chrysler windsor
edged off the gravel onto the highway
i thrust my head right where the plush fabric
of the front seat parted like the red sea,
and said to my new dad. “you know what.
i love warren more than i love you.”
“you don’t know what you’re saying,” he snapped.
“he’s just a little putz, and i can get
rid of him with a snap
of my fingers. presto. see. now—where is he?”
the seat beside me was empty. i was empty.
and my heart pounded in wild longing for its fullness lost.
i should have kept my mouth shut
but i thought my heart would burst
with that secret locked in it: why doesn’t he
understand? it wasn’t that i loved him less than i had
but that i loved warren more. he had the same reaction
several years later, in chicago, when i announced
my love for carol, a round-faced, soft spoken blond girl
i’d brought home to play with my electric trains and drink
hot chocolate one brutal winter afternoon. i loved her and
i kissed her in the elevator on the way up.
i wanted him to say: i’m so happy for you, let’s put on some 45’s and dance.
he said, “you don't know what love is.”
and for the first time slapped me in the face.
i wrote my “blood” father of my love and he wrote back
he was glad i was “making friends out there.”
why didn’t these men understand, i know what words mean,
by love i meant love, however transitory.
one word, two fathers, two red stone faces,
unblinking, dismayed.

dropouts.
mace had the kind of courage you could easily mistake
for brawn. i don’t know why i call it courage. sure, he stood up to greasers. and didn’t visibly fret
on the days when his report card made hard fact of what was already apparent from his absences.
yet mace was gifted with an uninflected quickness, a fine intelligence of his own despair, a knowledge—
as he gunned the engine of his once white ’58 chevy, with a four-on-the-floor he’d installed himself,
to climb higher into the hills above the city—of where nowhere was…
light shadow cutting brusquely across the canyons—
like everyone else in our class, mace was a year
older than me. he had stubble on his chin. i dragged a razor up and down my cheeks
to inspire fast, early growth. “don’t shave your jowls,” friends warned,
knowing i overdid everything, “or you’ll grow hair there later.” later was a word i disdained, its insistence on the future tense, postponement—
life on the back burner.*mace seemed incapable of worry.
his coolness and insouciance made girls stare. he was always brushing back the shock of raven-
black hair that fell over his right eyebrow. the same teacher who sent me lickety split
to the principal’s office would lean over mace’s desk and whisper
warmly, compassionately in his ear. they would nod together. i could fill in every blank.
“what’s the matter richard?” “nothing.” “if you’re having trouble,”
this is where the whispering grew most intense, “i want you to feel you can talk to me as a friend.
your work in class is so good, you have so much ability,
richard…” mace would never protest, never defend himself.
indignation was a country where he’d never been. “you may hate me,” i thought, praying she would not
double the insult of the absence of her concern for me with a glance in my direction,
“but deep down mace and i are the same.” *mace and i were running into the same problem
at the same time. mathematical wizards that we were we couldn’t solve
advanced algebraic equations in our head; we were vexed by an added integer.
we had gotten this far without lifting a pencil. history was being sold to us as a dead language
of fixed events and we wouldn’t buy. what is a fact, i wondered, and i could see
the same question wrinkling mace’s brow. mace’s problems weren’t academic. his disgust thrummed
like telephone wires in the wind, even his saturnine presence was deceptive, like his beat-up chevy
with its secret store of power concealed under the hood. mace too began the year in the front row,
placed there on the strength of pure ability. he sank slowly, buoyed as i was, by the one
assigned book we read, great expectations. mace attended to his tasks in the classroom.
i dreamt of escape via the window’s easy access. there were unknown roads to be driven, gulleys
to be plumbed; girls: a world of lovely distractions.
for all the years i lived in salt lake city
i can’t remember seeing a single bird .i felt watched in salt lake city ever since
that first day when the old geezer stepped out of the shadows, on a street vast and empty
and without verticals, to reprimand my double-
mint gum wrapper for lighting in the gutter.
but only around the time of hitchcock’s the birds did i start to withdraw from sight.
i was keen to see the birds the Wednesday afternoon it opened and i wanted the other—“good”—“mark r.,”
the irreproachable blond mormon angel everyone loved, to join us. our growling engine brought his mother to the porch.
the sun glared on her helmet of curlers. mark had “homework and chores,” she said, he “can’t come down.”
but he had already descended. and stood framed in the doorway. i couldn’t get accustomed to the light
in the trampled meadows around his house, the glow of dandelions, thistles, weeds.
mark’s red cheeks reeked of aspiration and i could read his thoughts: why couldn’t i wait until night? why was i dragging myself down?
why skip history and rifle assembly? the movie would wait. but i would not. i was keen,
and, seeking a purging terror to cleanse me of my dread, i sat alone with mace
in the vast empty theater alive to each click and flicker in the projection room,
and the radiant impalpable dust caught in the unstinting beam;
released from the limits of our world until the screeching stopped
and, looked at askance by strangers, we stepped into an iron dark
which held no trace of the light we’d left. 
i forked over whatever change i had
to fuel each day’s free-wheeling splendor.one morning, knowing mace was down to smoking butts,
i brought a pack of my mother’s kents as an offering. mace scorned them.
he only smoked marlboros. yet later, desperate and broke in the maze
of roads through the hills overlooking the city, he broke off the filters and smoked in silence.
i was used to doing the talking for the two of us but this was different.
he pulled up besides a long driveway. a vaulted roof jutted above columns of tall firs.
this was where he lived. he’d be “a sec”—he had “some smokes” stashed in a drawer.
i followed him past the plaster jockey and the massy trees toward an opulent, utterly contemporary house,
fronted by oak door and gold bell-knocker, angular, white, high-ceilinged, skylit…
our apartment could have fit into the living room…now i understood: mace lived in the clouds.
though i couldn’t see beyond the back yard through the landscaping i knew what the view
must be like: that was the reason to live there; for the nights, when the city, innocent as it was,
still blazed through its grid of interlocking lights.
*on may day, mace and i, long ago tossed
out of r.o.t.c. for “insubordination,” but required to attend the final show-of-arms
sat together in the bleachers, in splendid isolation, and watched
as the rule-followers—led by the many-striped, other mark r.—
in their woolen khaki uniforms, shouldering their m 1 rifles,
dropped like flies in the insuperable heat.

korea might be gay but i do not think you are.
korea is a peninsula. you and i are people meaning that
we have hair we comb and things to look at. our lips
pout and take on the fullness of an adopted meaning. 
the fact of the matter is that relentlessness is a hand-
shake, a limp fish or glass of lukewarm tea. the fact of 
the matter is that standing on a stage everything is
comic, meaning small and memorable, of the insubstan-
tial "universe," a minor disaster or floating chord. 
the darkness is outside when i see you, not in. 
i laugh when the funny thing gets said, and mostly i
laugh inside. on the inside is without curves and artifi-
cial spaces, many of them not gay or korea. but when i 
see you they all run and speech is maybe stammer,
sometimes slur. 
margaret cho, your tongue might wreak more havoc
than in speaks, outside being from the vantage point of
escalating stairs, from dark glasses and escapades. the
vantage being from a great height, a lighter space on
the inside that was formerly before the dark and laugh.
we really wait for the funny things before they are said
and let go for ever after. 
margaret, there are many funny sisters and there are
many porn stores. i too think woo lae ok is really petri-
fied of its own fish. that there are babies and there are
dykes, that this little piggy has something, that a pubic
mound transforms into a public space, not being gay or
with outstanding curves, prayerful and abashed, facing
the tide, grown over, rediscovered in the woods by
strangers and haunted for years and years.

these are our secrets. our punch lines and couplets.
i went to bed thinking "pixies." the bliss and after-
math of a spiritual kiss.
how you resonate without rooms, maintaining perfect
valences. 
where is the disaster at the end of this dread?
in my dream state you were queen, a reigning

i climbed inside your belly. punched inside you
laughed and laughed,
converting persimmons into a freedom jelly.
slathered all over, i found us exuberant,
happy to swing or go both ways.

and yesterday something shattering happened.
not yesterday, but several (that’s becoming
a favorite word) weeks ago i came across
kitaj’s the jewish rider and wept:
there he was in the very image of my stepfather;
the pate where a few strands of hair still frolic,
the same skinny legs, the same misguided
attempt to dress in a sporty way (who’s
watching?), the same abstractedness,
the same shlumpy—boneless—posture, gazing not
at the landscape flashing past
with wires lashed to the treetops as if with one
tug the countryside would vanish,
or listening to the tick of the rails,
but fixed—distractedly—on his lower extremities,
white loafers and the crease in his pants and nylon
socks to see whether or not he should roll them up … ;
no: looking both beyond and through physical space
into an inner dark. why else draw the eyes as shadows?
it’s his glimpse into another world.*my mother’s father hunted and rode.
my father rode and fished.
my stepfather never budged
from his barca lounger
once the amber liquid began to pour. he had a spiritual life
and a social life and no
physical life. but he liked it
that i was always outside:
maybe that’s why he never
got on my back about grades;
he might have thought
that this boy has to be outside
at this time in his life. 
maybe it’s more important
that he roam the canyons and the hills 
that he know the streets 
that he come home 
covered with leaves and bark and mud,
than that he sit there 
like a good young scholar 
like i was, a rabbi 
at twenty giving money home
to my parents in their cabbagy tenement 
in the bronx. this is a boy
who needs space. one time—
i think i had my learner's permit—
he rented a mustang
convertible in l.a. and for several
days i drove around
past the long rows of used car lots
and the bruised facades of restaurants
digging up relatives, my hoarse-voiced
arthritic aunt in the shadows of
her goldenrod colored ranch house,
limping like ruffian
after her last run
in the wet dirt at belmont stakes.*but i’ve said nothing about what made me weep.it's in the contrast between kitaj's alter cocker
seeking comfort on a train,
and rembrandt’s taut youth
setting off into the rampant amber on horseback;
it’s in the image of active life juxtaposed
with the image of sedentary contemplation—
though no one travels on horseback now
and heroism has become
attending aids patients
or sheltering the homeless.
the raw youth’s feet are planted
lightly yet firmly in his stirrups.
his coat glows with many colors. not so the jewish rider.
and yet—there's something more. michael hoffman writes that new york
is not what it was when i was too young
to have marked the existence of the blue note,
but i can pick up this trail
by walking across the park to the frick.
and barbara hershey wouldn’t have been at the frick in 1959
(they don’t allow children under sixteen)
in black skin tight pants, black sweater,
(the female uniform of our generation
whose male version substitutes
black jeans, baseball hat, and bomber jacket—
though who knows what decorous garments
she’d checked in the cloakroom),
and white boots with plenty
of elizabethan ruff at the edges,
pausing to look at the polish rider
while i scribbled notes. her white
boots stood out against the dominant dark
like the jewish rider’s white loafers. and that was good because the light in the painting is brief
whatever the time of day, sunrise or sunset,
and the rider’s gaze, looking out over
unknown space, is inward.
i followed his eyes through the archway toward canvases
where clouds roll over harbors
against the whiteness of sails
or toward gilded robes and velvet-hung rooms,
then back to meet wisdom’s bared breast
in veronese’s wisdom and strength…
(why didn’t veronese have the nerve
to call his painting woman
with bare breasts, like tintoretto?
why an allegorical title when the bare
flesh and bones and sinew would have done?)
he spends his life looking not
at far off hills or citadels or
the lights in the village below:
he has no choice but to fix
on her one bared breast, her swelling nipple.
i can’t figure out what landscape
he might be facing in the painted world.
the clatter of rocks and hooves
echoes over the stony plain.*i was no rider, but a pretend
horse and rider always rode
beside my train window—at a canter
no matter how fast the rails clicked by—
and though he wore a bandana
and leaned slightly forward in the saddle
to pull himself aboard,
his gaze, wide-ranging yet intent,
was like the polish rider’s. even as an only child i was never lonely.my mother's father rode until he was old
and on a narrow pass his horse
jammed him up against rockface.
in his narrative of his life
this collision marked
the ruin of his hip
the rise of his cataracts.my father rode “every morning before work.” i never witnessed that,
but at a ranch in upper new york state
while i bloodied my hands
tugging the reins of a frothing giant
who would not budge from a weedpatch,
i watched him disappear
in his black polo shirt and khaki jodhpurs
as he galloped over a far off hill:
more at ease in the saddle—in the air—
than i’d ever seen him in civilian life.my woman friend in el paso lives to ride. only the jewish rider and i do not ride!*that’s the stuff of events. what about
the signature inscribed by the sun,
the dark clouds sinister in just being there;
thresholds, exchanges going on in the village below,
candles lit in the deep interiors,
bread, wine, the plate making its way
around the table; what about—leaping centuries ahead—
the energy from generators blazing
like auras through the clouds
the scattered lights,
the rotating tops of ambulances;
the tuna casseroles and macaroni and cheesemaking the rounds, apple sauce
passing from high chair to bib, the wonder bread
on a calcified plate,
children eating, heads down, in silence,
communicating through eye movements,
the mother wiping her lips, the father
grinning stupidly and drooling; the television quacking in the background,
the perfect suburban night unfolding
in bedroom and drive-in and den,
the sprinkler system ticking.
the snipers in the tower—.
this is what the riders,
guests everywhere and nowhere, say goodbye to as their horses break into a canter
as night comes down. and last
night, driving to connecticut,
i understood that the polish rider
gleans the permutations of light after dusk,
that its olive-gray smudges reflect
the absence of pitch-darkness. i was wrong about the polish rider all along:
he doesn’t depart at nightfall, he stops for a moment
crossing difficult terrain (anticipating rockslide?)
in the night, because, as the faint light
rimming the edges of the sky makes clear,
night is not absolute black, but rough-hewn and curious.
the rider lives in order to depart. the woman who rode she hitched her horse to the gateposts of my house.
bare trees, frost, the whole bit. i wanted our lives to be like that:
as rife with silences as a quaker meeting. she came to me in her stride.
dropped her crop on the chair. peeled off her britches and boots; crawled
under the covers. her hour in the saddle had “made her ready.”
i felt like an accessory. the wound was open. drowsily i rolled
onto her, no longer caring if shewas using me. as the new
year wore on and black ice made riding a fast track to certain death
or paralysis, she grew tense. came to me now with clinical terms,
“schi” words i worked hard to break down. the good news was she was not a true
“split personality”—the glitch that “she was divorced
from herself, and could not love or care.”*the light in her house
was like the light before dawn. on the last of my rare visits
her mother jarred preserves while we watched instant replays of robert kennedy die and die.
her father skulked upstairs, perhaps testing gadgets; or wishing me off his daughter;
or taking precautions i would not overhear what words were ricocheting
on his “hot line” to the patent office.*any objective observer standing back
from the distraction of the impinging present could see that her torment overleapt
any visible signs and that she was—as a wasp “rider”—the wrong
person for the place she was in. her resilience could not be in question.
she lived to stray from known paths to leap stone fences and break into open fields.
when her horse went down in an irish bog and she was trampled—hooves branding her cheek—
the next day she up and mounted him again.*when she came to me in the dream last night
her smile had loosened. how lovely she looked in her blue silk blouse.
how well it lit up the colors of her hair.

papered in requiem blue. partiers crowd the burned kitchen,
gold fixtures hook to cheap lath. what is it they can tell you about absence
how it abates, takes names becomes a wall with windows
faced on a formal garden, content to accept the thin rain. the syllable
forgives the words that need it, a sentence badly written, epigraphs scrawled
thoughtlessly in books. book where the herocon fronts a dark riddle, book where

i can’t get rid of useful things
and nobody wants to pick them up,
i keep forgetting where i lay my umbrella. i don’t leave footprints in the snow anymore,
we haven’t had a war on domestic soil in so long
i wonder if i still got it. because once i had it. i heard about a boy who once tied a string to his brother,
he tied his brother to the ocean and the ocean to the blackbird—from the ground all the birds look like blackbirds
from the ground a stealth bomber looks like a spaceship. the aliens are coming,
they walk through birthday parties
and basically go unnoticed. and this is kind of how i go through life,
once i heated up a spoon in the microwave
the fish have so much mercury in them they spark. i was handed a bayonet from the civil war
and a copper penny corroded with rust.
when they take the statue of liberty apart to clean her
her neck explodes with a million little spiders. meanwhile in a forest somewhere
someone cut open my grandmother’s belly
and filled it with bricks something is coming soon
i keep a bucket of lambs blood

like nights we knelt on the dirt floor
of a dugout, leaned our heads back,
eyes twitching gone, and popped nitrous
canisters into the communion shapes
of our mouths, slipped inside where
everything seemed to be falling snow,
ice, the time split between chasing flies
through a darkened park and sprawling
in sycamore bark—how clean that abyss
we drifted in, like dew, more like pollen,
on our skins; and, beneath, a want
for touch, a kiss, a return. like nothing
back then, to break an arm latching on
to the bumper of an impala, or settling back 
as the car took us as far as the salted bridge,
before letting the ride go with a mitten
caught behind the chrome waving
from the other side of the river. like this, 
you said, sliding a needle, watching
dope plunge, the body's rush and tow
until you felt something like an angel
hovering above, but it was only pigeon
feathers deviling the air. those friends
are gone: some dead, dying, locked up
or jailed in themselves; and when i see
some kids running in the heat of a taillight
swirling behind them, i remember we
wanted only to quiet our bodies, their 
unnatural hum, a vague pull inward,
some thin furrows gliding over the snow.

all of us were boys only some were taller or already in high school, and almost
nothing else
mattered but to learn some new trick,
to pull off something we saw in a skate video, wind cutting 
around our bodies when we flew
off the lip of a ramp, grabbed the board and twisted
into a 180, kicking 
a leg out and landing it, the only way to run
through the neighborhood
was to run through it
together, flipping off cops and skinheads, i almost
don't even remember girls but a vague sense of the taste of bubble gum
and how they smelled so different
from us, sitting in some kid's basement drinking
his parents' vodka, we grew out our bangs, moved in a pack,
jumped in when some one of us 
got jumped,
so when a man we had never seen before
came up and started beating on simon, one of us dropped his skateboard, walked
over to the man
like someone walking into a bank
and stabbed him.
the man, startled, sat down, right there on the asphalt,
right in the middle of his new consciousness,
kind of looking around.

my mother and i are on the front porch lighting each other's cigarettes
as if we were on a ten-minute break from our jobs
at being a mother and son, just ten minutes
to steal a moment of freedom before clocking back in, before
putting the aprons back on, the paper hats,
washing our hands twice and then standing
behind the counter again,
hoping for tips, hoping the customers
will be nice, will say some kind word, the cool
front yard before us and the dogs 
in the backyard shitting on everything.
we are hunched over, two extras on the set of the night of the hunter.
i am pulling a second cigarette out of the pack, a swimmer
rising from a pool of other swimmers. soon we will go back
inside and sit in the yellow kitchen and drink
the rest of the coffee 
and what is coming to kill us will pour milk
into mine and sugar into hers.

one of the very first indian words to enter the english language was the hindustani slang for plunder: "loot."
william dalrympleit sits with a fork made from a lotus on an ivory chair eating an elephant steak in the company of bears and feral nautch girls on a monsoon evening incandescent with an appetite as mighty as railroads spann’d across seas and reclines, its cheeks burnished, its ass varnished by suns setting on bronze and sugared with saltpetre, its torso a tableaux for the annals of rectitude, the theatre for roiling or robust passage, a veritable suez canal towards missionary victories which thrust from such bejeweled and oiled loins anointed by coin— that emission of plump plums, lump sums into the ganges, that coiling coy virgin maiden winding her languid locks, batting her lashes to its lashes— its spine a gentle wire. supine, its belly swells with salt and figs with meat and treaties, it corks open a profound song— itself it sings into books heavy with truths on the chair dressed with leather and raw hides kissed by ox blood smeared with beef dung lined with raw silk woven from worms plucked from boughs basted across its pious beaming eyes its spidery ghosted lids, and its byzantine glance unmoors from its chinese porcelain and crosses the ebony table polished with lac secreted from the cloaca of the kerria lacca set with glazed cakes eaten by pinked mouths wearing crimson robes, to its guests polished and glossed and stained by the ooze drawn to color the uncolored raw linen, the wood, the human. then its wrist cuffed by gold and cowries and studded with coral draws a whisper- thin muslin veil dyed carmine— sucked from crushed scale of cochineal boiled in ammonia and bled into curds and rouge glinting sanguineous and turbid between bug and rug snug a thug in redcoat or a turncoat carrying urns of this stuff— from estates of cocoa coconut calico— across its face while soft éclairs of chocolate bumble out from its plumed rump choked with gum and linseed flax and cassia cinnamon and pepper like so many lines of blood underwriting the mutton and not the goat so it can sell them with a name of a place like scarves or garlanded whores moored to wharves suckled by mother of pearl or teas named after earls and they with whole scores to settle settle for homemade cures nettles ginger turmeric— a paste or to taste—and it steals and seals in letters scented with sandal sent abroad waxed and pressed with cornelian gems honed from ground it owns and makes stone from their flesh ekes ink from their sweat soaks indigo in lye fermented with time and makes color so it can bid for its own passage, the passage, o of this soul, to india!

there once lived a great king whose twin wives could bear him no children. a wandering sage saw the king’s grief and offered him a magical mango. she who ate the mango would be with child. as he had two wives, the king cut the mango into two perfect halves and offered one half to each wife. after nine months, each wife gave birth to one lifeless half. horrified, the king ordered these clots of flesh to be left in the forest. a wandering demon found the two lifeless halves and cupped one in each palm. when she brought them together, the two halves fused and a whole child was made in front of her eyes—the demon named the child jarasandha.
years passed by and this child grew to be an intimidating and invincible warrior. in a fight with bhim, an equally invincible warrior, jarasandha was ripped in half by his enemy. but, each time he was ripped apart, his halves found a way to meet up and become whole. krishna, who witnessed how jarasandha’s flesh found its own way back to flesh, motioned to his own cousin with his fingers: toss the halves of his body in opposite directions, he
suggested.
so, when bhim ripped jarasandha apart once again, he swung his left half to the right side of the arena and his right half to the left. and his body found no way to return to itself.
in the toronto airport, where i’ve arrived for a conference, i watch an older punjabi lady—made to sit in a wheelchair behind two lines of customs officials, a security guard, a translator, and a service-staff member—scream that her son is outside the airport may she please just go tell him she is here she is here she is here please. i stand there holding her hand, my own luggage reluctantly traveling in loops on the belt. beta—child— she says to me: please tell them my son is here and i am here what is the problem let me go let me go to him.

in the epilogue to the autobiography of malcolm x, alex haley recounts meeting a pensive malcolm at the kennedy airport, watching newly immigrated children “romping and playing” in their sudden home. “by tomorrow night,” malcolm says to alex, “they’ll know how to say their first english word—nigger.”
before cable television arrived in india, america was a white nation. i imagined new england snows dusting california and miami’s beaches stretched across appalachia. america was a papier-mâché parody patched together by a cheaply hired prop maker. geographic accuracy was sacrificed to the interpersonal dramas of betty and veronica, and the american banquet was limited to the malted and fried offerings in pop’s chock’lit shoppe, where the riverdale gang solved the real geopolitical problems of how to get reggie off moose’s back with the help of archie’s fumbling charms. here, class warfare came with a side of fries. there were rumors of distant family members “settling” in “north dakota” or “oklahoma”—names that put themselves together like lego castles: hard-edged and jutting out with an abrupt l or a particularly pokey k.
blackness was just a rumor too. blackness flickered in the background of photographs they sent back from these mysterious locations: here’s an uncle waving at us from a glittering times square (los angeles); here’s an aunt waving at us mid-way through the soft-focus neon breakfasts with aunt jemima’s maple syrup (made from maple leaves); here’s a nephew waving at us next to the poster of a red and white michael jordan in a quilted bedroom, his rotund brown body snuggled in tie-dye and tucked into tartan flannel sheets. blackness was a rumor, that is, until michael jackson’s bad ripped into our consciousness and suddenly, knobby-kneed pre-teens found a way to make stringy curls with coconut oil stolen from their mothers’ kitchens and started moonwalking backwards into my social studies classrooms, all snappy crotch and jaunty limbs. we girls rolled our eyes but we kept on watching.
it wasn’t long before jackson’s unsparing gaze, draped in slick black leather, began replacing the glowing pastel ganeshes and saraswatis hanging above study desks. but replacing an elephantine god’s soft paunch with lean, mean celebrity did not save us from our own ignorance of how blackness and brownness were connected through a struggle for economic self-realization and human rights. while kids in chennai were rehearsing michael peters’ signature choreography for “thriller” and pretending to be zombies—little exemplary half-dead spectacles—union carbide was industriously shirking responsibility for the bhopal tragedy, which choked thousands of indians to death, and black mortality was spiking in violent, homicidal protest of the us dea’s drug buys and cocaine busts.
in other words, tamilians blinked away michael jackson’s blackness. we kept the heat and thunder of his fat synth bass, which found its way into ilayaraaja’s electric disco in films of the late 1980s like vetri vizha and agni natchathiram. we kept the ebullient automation of his moves, which became a muscular theme in prabhu deva’s blend of baggy breakdance and whimsical terukoothu folk dancing in the 1990s. but we forgot his blackness. in time, the lightning of his presence was replaced by the grey hum of cnn, cops, law & order, and the dull horror of handcuffs on dark wrists. posters yellowed, cassettes spooled out, and my moonwalking classmates found their scientific calculators and study guides again.
but the rumors of racial difference in george bush sr.’s america continued to bloom and wilt in morose cycles in my childhood homes into the 1990s. in damp clusters, it grew like moss under rocks. rootless, it stretched its stringy arms and held us by the ankles; it grew like mold between bathroom tiles; it spun itself fine and strong, webbing into corners where our brooms couldn’t reach. in time, the mossy rocks lined our after-dinner walks past the hibiscus bushes. in time, a grandmother slipped on the bathroom tiles and stayed in bed, fed conjee by a fatherless girl brought in from the village and the moss grew between her toes and drew her into the earth where they buried the nameless pets and tossed the chicken feathers. in time, the spiders hung so low they fell into pickle jars every time a child fished for a gooseberry or a slice of stony green mango from the brine. and from this brine, in time, we learned to believe that it existed. and as tamilian families began drifting from the flashy monsoons of india to the june gloom of the california bay or to the sharp wet summers of the keys, they carried the damp and stench in suitcases and buried it in hushed conversations. they made a poultice of moss and spider web and lodged it in the prayer books, hung it around the children’s necks like a talisman, and they said—as long as she doesn’t marry a black man.

it was hard to sit there with my father,
watching one of my sister's girls playing
a set of tennis against my son or daughter
because he'd forget himself and with a groan
of disappointment or a grunt
of sympathetic exertion make it clear
that he was rooting for my sister's child
and against mine. there was no use
calling him on it, because he'd deny it
and get angry. so i would get angry
but try not to show it, until i couldn't
stand it any longer and would get up
and walk away. that was how it worked
between us, the unspoken building up
like thunderheads above the tennis court,
where the kids played on, not caring who won
and hardly noticing the sky had darkened.

someone has opened a giant map
and with the tips of our fingers,
each of us suddenly blind,
we track the black cold of this monument
for names we know
like finding a route home. lost here
this damp spring morning,
the cherries exploding like the fourth of july,
we wonder how many maps of vietnam
sold those years,
so many strange sounding places.one of us holds a magnifying glass
to mccarroll, mcmorris, mcnabb,
small print in the polished stone,
the way a neighbor, say, in neoga, illinois
might have done, late at night
searching that faraway land on his kitchen table, hearing again the morning paper
thump against the front door,
that boy on his bike in the dark
grown and gone—what was his name, that kid from down the block?—
khe sanh, da nang, hanoi.--for pfc william "willie" searle

though the doctors said no salt,
salt was all my father craved.
his body bloated, skin water-logged
and gray, still he wanted potato chips,
honey-baked ham, greasy slabs
of polish sausage from piekutowski's.
he begged for pepperoni pizza,
garlic butter, ribs slathered in sauce.
but when i did the shopping,
i searched only for labels that saidlow sodium and no preservatives, instead
bringing home heads of broccoli,
turkey burgers, shredded wheat.
and when he died anyway,
guilt gnawed me like an ulcer—
how could i have denied him
his few final pleasures?—
until i found big mac wrappers
stuffed under the car seat,
jars of pickles in the hall closet,
and hidden among wads of tissues
near the night stand, his stash—
a half-used canister of salt.
i sat down on his sagging mattress
now stripped of stained sheets
and studied that blue label
with the girl in the yellow dress
holding her umbrella against a rain
of salt still falling from the sky.

look, the sycamores, their mottled,

rusting and crisping at the edges.
i walk through schiller park with you
on my chest. stars smolder well
into daylight. look, the pond, the ducks,
the dogs paddling after their prized sticks.
fall is when the only things you know
because i’ve named them
begin to end. soon i’ll have another
season to offer you: frost soft
on the window and a porthole
sighed there, ice sleeving the bare
gray branches. the first time you see
something die, you won’t know it might
come back. i’m desperate for you
to love the world because i brought you here.

my daughter says. unless the car could float.
unless by car you mean boat. unless the ocean
turned to ice and promised not to crack.
unless greenland floated over here,
having lifted its anchor. unless we could row
our country there. our whole continent
would have to come along, wouldn't it? unless
we cut ourselves free. what kind of saw
could we use for that? what kind of oars
could deliver one country to another?
she asks, why is greenland called greenland
if it’s not green? why is iceland called
iceland if it’s greener than greenland?
unless it’s a trick, a lie: the name greenland
is an ad for greenland. who would go
promised nothing but ice? who would cut
her home to pieces and row away for that?

because a lie is not a lie if the teller
believes it, the way beautiful things reassure us of the world’s wholeness,
of our wholeness, is not quite a lie. beautiful things believe their own
narrative, the narrative that makes them beautiful. i almost believed it
until the new mother strapped her infant to her chest, opened
the eighth-floor window, and jumped. my daughter tells me,
after her preschool field trip to the firefighter museum,
about the elephant mask, its hoselike a trunk, and the video of a man
on fire being smothered in blankets. she asks me if she knows anyone
who got dead in a fire, anyone who
got fired. when will i die? she asks.
when i was a child, i churched my hands, i steepled my hands,
and all the people were inside, each finger a man, a woman,
a child. when i die, will you
still love me? she asks. the mother
cracked on the pavement—how did the baby live? look,
he smiles and totters around the apartment eight stories up.
beautiful things reassure us of the world’s wholeness:
each child sliding down the pole into the fire captain’s arms.
but what’s whole doesn’t sell itself as such: buy this whole apple,
this whole car. live this whole life. a lie is not a lie if the teller
believes it? next time the man in the video will not ignite.
the baby will open like a parachute.

i carried my fear of the world
to my children, but they refused it. i carried my fear of the world
on my chest, where i once carried
my children, where some nights it slept
as newborns sleep, where it purred
but mostly growled, where it licked
sweat from my clavicles. i carried my fear of the world
and apprenticed myself to the fear. i carried my fear of the world
and it became my teacher.
i carried it, and it repaid me
by teaching me how to carry it. i carried my fear of the world
the way an animal carries a kill in its jaws
but in reverse: i was the kill, the gift.
whose feet would i be left at? i carried my fear of the world
as if it could protect me from the world .i carried my fear of the world
and for my children modeled marveling
at its beauty but keeping my hands still—
keeping my eyes on its mouth, its teeth. i carried my fear of the world.
i stroked it or i did not dare to stroke it. i carried my fear of the world
and it became my teacher.
it taught me how to keep quiet and still i carried my fear of the world
and my love for the world.
i carried my terrible awe. i carried my fear of the world
without knowing how to set it down. i carried my fear of the world
and let it nuzzle close to me,
and when it nipped, when it bit
down hard to taste me, part of me
shined: i had been right. i carried my fear of the world
and it taught me i had been right.
i carried it and loved it
for making me right .i carried my fear of the world
and it taught me how to carry it. i carried my fear of the world
to my children and laid it down
at their feet, a kill, a gift.
or i was laid at their feet.

she was my sunday school teacher
when i was just seven and eight.
he was the newly hired pastor, an albino, alarming sight
with his transparent eyelashes
and mouse-pink skin that looked like it might hurt whenever she caressed
his arm. since eva was her name,
to my child’s mind it made great sense that she should fall in love with him.
he was adán. before the fall
and afterward, her invert twin. and she, eva, was blonde as well,
though more robust, like liv ullmann.
i loved her honey hair, her fulllips; her green eyes a nameless sin.
(not that i worried all that much—
the church was presbyterian.)in sunday school, her way to teach
us kids to pray was to comment
on all the beauty we could touch or see in our environment.
my hand was always in the air
to volunteer my sentiment. since other kids considered prayer
a chore, the floor was usually mine.
my list of joys left out her hair but blessed the red hibiscus seen
through the windows while others bowed
their heads. her heart i schemed to win with purple prose on meringue clouds.
—for who was adán, anyway,
i thought, but nada spelled backward? while hers, reversed, called out, ave! ave! the lyric of a bird
born and airborne on the same day. but it was night when i saw her
outside the church for the last time:
yellow light, mosquitoes, summer. i shaped a barking dog, a fine
but disembodied pair of wings
with my hands. she spoke in hushed tones to my parents. the next day i would find
myself up north, in a strange house,
without my tongue and almost blind, there was so much to see. this caused
cuba, my past, to be eclipsed
in time, but eva stayed, a loss.
ave, i learned, meant also this: farewell! i haven’t seen her since.

in art, politics, school, church, business, love
or marriage—in a piece of work or in a career—
strongly spent is synonymous with kept. 
—robert frostshe taught me the names of flowers: calendula, ranunculus, iceland
poppy. and the medicinal uses of herbs: fenugreek opens up a
stuffy head; goldenseal lubricates the cracked mucous membranes.
over a circa 1820 american dropleaf table, she told me asparagus
was the broom of the kidneys. i hadn't understood at first and
thought she'd used a german word i pictured as brüm and not as the
little stalks standing on their heads, sweeping out the impurities. i
learned to make the perfect roux for soufflé and became her
efficient assistant in the kitchen—dicing and chopping, she once
told me, with unparalleled patience. then one day she began to
accidentally break my depression glassware, and i recalled how
she'd giggled when she told me that in two years of marriage she
had single-handedly decimated her husband's glass collection
dating from 1790 to 1810, including a rare wedding goblet. in the
doorway to the back porch she stated simply that my presence
made her feel strangled, it was nothing i was doing or could do. we
saw a therapist for six years, while my collection dwindled then
became memory. with unparalleled patience i jumped through
hoop after burning hoop, the therapist pointed out, but i heard that
as praise for my prowess and continued to balance bauer plates on
my nose on command; hold growling tigers off with windsor dining
room chairs; juggle career, job, hope, and nightly tempests with
unparalleled dexterity. i could reassemble anything: shattered pictures
of us crossing the street with canes in the future, my hand under her
elbow. my heart. but what i lacked, i can see now, was the ability
to dissemble. finally, she brought home a cuisinart food processor,
and i started hearing the minutes slicing away with ferocious velocity,
time doing its soft-shoe faster and faster like fred astaire on
amphetamines. memories of flowers and herbs were sacrificed to
the angry god of its vortex. your voice is like acid on my skin, she
said after twelve years, then grabbed her cuisinart and left me
behind like so much history.

there are no doors between the rooms. the archways bore
through the house like a tunnel through a mountain. the room
one falls into after my parents’ is the largest and serves as two
bedrooms divided by an invisible wall. half of it is my brother’s
and the other half my sister and i share, but not at first. earlier, i have a bed to myself on the side of the room nearest the
kitchen. my bed is low and on one side a wooden rail can be
dragged up noisily and clicked into place.it is here my little goat wakes me, grabbing the covers off
me with her teeth. we play in the empty pig shelter at the
far end of the patio while my mother washes clothes in a
palangana and throws the soapy water across the concrete,
where it steams. but my father is a butcher by profession, and my family
has other plans for my goat: a sunday picnic at the zoo in
havana. the day is huge and blue and breezy. my sister
teases me for not eating and says my goat is delicious. i
stray away to watch the monkeys. i give one of the monkeys near the fence my banana. as it
finishes peeling it meticulously, another monkey appears
behind it and shoves the banana into its own mouth. the
first monkey turns around, slaps it in the face with the
empty peel, but that monkey isn’t sorry and starts jumping
and screeching and showing its yellow teeth. for many years, those monkeys are all i can remember
about the picnic at the zoo.b.
later, when my sister and i share a bed on the other side of the room,
i can see the tall narrow cabinet right inside my parents’ room. my
father always puts his hat on top of it as he walks in. and at night,
through the mosquito netting, it is a tall thin man wearing a straw
hat, lurking just outside the door, watching me in a sinister way. the
dead weight of my sister’s habitual leg thrown across my body is no
talisman. i have to keep waking myself up, sweaty and tense, to
make sure he hasn’t moved any closer.

regla lesbia: flexible rule that may be adjusted to any
body to be measured. compare regla fija: standard. 
—the velázquez dictionaryi.
in the garden, it’s there. even when you’re inside you feel it,
as though it were you standing naked among the weeds, the tips of the bougainvillea bursting into flame, your nipples
ruffled like the skin of a lake by a breeze. you worship the invisible body like an old-fashioned lover, from afar,
loving the specificity of space between you. sometimes at night it stretches out on the empty side
of the bed, stares at you with the length of its invisible surface. every contour of your body not filled by you is molded
by the attentiveness of the invisible body, whose breath surrounds
you. it’s more than prayer it wants—more than language, with its
conditions.
the invisible body demands you invent new senses to receive it, new places on your body to marvel at its subtlety,
like the eyes of the deaf percussionist that perceive sound.
the invisible body wants you to become a satellite dish,
tuned to what exists only because your body calls to it. like the woman who had her kitchen remodeled to make room
for the microwave she’d entered a contest for. then won.
when asked whether falling in love was about acquisitiveness,
about the ego, the seventy-five-year-old poet responded that the ego had nothing to do with it;
it was the need for union with the beloved. rumi asks, who is it we spend our entire lives loving? 
how, then, do you measure the invisible body,
which resists commitment but is faithful? is it clear who the beloved is, when no clear
body exists that can be measured against a standard?
the invisible body sometimes acquires a body—it’s so convincing,
it takes you a while to figure out it’s really the invisible body. like someone who has been reading your journal,
it has decoded from your petty, daily complaints the open sesame that slides the stone from the hidden cave’s opening
and cleans you out while you sleep, leaving a sarcastic note.it wants you to know it was doing you a favor, besides,
how else did you think you’d discover the cave’s precise location? when aphrodite sharpens you, you sacrifice a little of yourself,
willingly, as a knife does, so that you may become better at it.vi.
this is the point at which the invisible body speaks
in italics, the ouija board of poetry.
in my mind, says the invisible body, that time capsule shuttling through space, i hold, in all the languages of the world,
your love, rushed like holographic platters to a table, steaming into the future long after you’ve ceased to shine,
the silver faces of your beloved bobbing out of the darkness, the black velvet pillow of your life on which you offer them for view.
the invisible body is created out of your longing, your longing
compressing invisible molecules together into an absence you
recognize. that is the way one blind man sees the world—after the fact,
in photographs he took, once he had passed through it.

recycled over and over
people born look like parents,
grandparents, sister or brother,
or perhaps a throwback
from an earlier ancestor,
the hawk nose, a hard ridged forehead,
the cleft in the chin or a blue birthmark
on the arm, the stomach,
the dainty fresh bum of a newborn
each unique like a snowflake never
can you guess what’s on their mind
sometimes i can feel what they’re feeling
detect it like hairs on the back of my arms,
together we live, talk, walk the same sidewalks,
to die buried in a foreign cemetery
for others to sit upon ponder their
own light, why am i free, what must i do,
does someone love me like i do,
new skin gives way to wrinkles,
hair fades to gray, bones grow strong
then decay, strength seeps every time

if the ashes of mark twain
lie in the mississippi river
then i’m sure he does rise up some days
emerge from dark polluted depths
to walk over water to land
and scans the horizon for change
being a curious sort,
he sees the crisis rise again
another war on the horizon
and shakes his craggy head to say no not again
he hopes truth-sayers still exist
who don’t have to wait until their dead. december 2002

impossible. 
sterile extrusion
the rigour of its beauty
its crumpled geometry
worked to defeat.
light, stopped.
locked in its form
shuttered and windless
in dry rifts,
split, furrowed, mottled, creased.
trundling
bulging from behind, 
its too heavy body
its natural carapace
shelving green,
sinking the sea beneath it
the difficulty piling up,
rising to the surface. 
swirling backward
on blue flowering currents
rolling up
sudden, in spray and mist
—like the turning of a page
that leaves us blinded for a second—
unlocked in a milky scum
half hid, long on its axis
growing open wounds
of violet, emerald, silver.
a point of astonishment.
lapses of silence. air.

i am in my body. i am here, in front of you. i am the temperature in this room. i am undressed in my nudity; i am the light and shade you feel. i am more like other people than like you. i have before and after. i am my self, entirely and only. my outside and inside are continuous. i am muscle, organ, fluid, bone. i am monumental. you are the only one who sees me. ii. 
i am not naked as i am; i am naked as you see me. i am transparent, almost visible. i have a time and a place. i am tribal and exotic. i must always carry objects. you are heroic. i am a complete museum, the story of my own making. i am a mirror to you; you are reflected in the looking at me. at best, i mimic you. you write me. when you leave, i will no longer exist. iii. 
i am a single conscious point. i am indifferent. i am unself, like a photogram. i am prehistoric, before definition. your body falls over me. i have depth and luminescence. i am neither here nor there; i have infinite extension. i live inside the lived world, the light and dark inside my head like dream substance. i am camera obscura, the room itself. i both adore and resist.

one face looks out from all his canvases,
one selfsame figure sits or walks or leans:
we found her hidden just behind those screens,
that mirror gave back all her loveliness.
a queen in opal or in ruby dress,
a nameless girl in freshest summer-greens,
a saint, an angel — every canvas means
the same one meaning, neither more or less.
he feeds upon her face by day and night,
and she with true kind eyes looks back on him,
fair as the moon and joyful as the light:
not wan with waiting, not with sorrow dim;
not as she is, but was when hope shone bright;
not as she is, but as she fills his dream.

three sang of love together: one with lips
crimson, with cheeks and bosom in a glow,
flushed to the yellow hair and finger tips;
and one there sang who soft and smooth as snow
bloomed like a tinted hyacinth at a show;
and one was blue with famine after love,
who like a harpstring snapped rang harsh and low
the burden of what those were singing of.
one shamed herself in love; one temperately
grew gross in soulless love, a sluggish wife;
one famished died for love. thus two of three
took death for love and won him after strife;
one droned in sweetness like a fattened bee:
all on the threshold, yet all short of life.

it's a weary life, it is, she said:
doubly blank in a woman's lot:
i wish and i wish i were a man:
or, better then any being, were not:
were nothing at all in all the world,
not a body and not a soul:
not so much as a grain of dust
or a drop of water from pole to pole.
still the world would wag on the same,
still the seasons go and come:
blossoms bloom as in days of old,
cherries ripen and wild bees hum.
none would miss me in all the world,
how much less would care or weep:
i should be nothing, while all the rest
would wake and weary and fall asleep.

i tell my secret? no indeed, not i;
perhaps some day, who knows?
but not today; it froze, and blows and snows,
and you’re too curious: fie!
you want to hear it? well:
only, my secret’s mine, and i won’t tell.
or, after all, perhaps there’s none:
suppose there is no secret after all,
but only just my fun.
today’s a nipping day, a biting day;
in which one wants a shawl,
a veil, a cloak, and other wraps:
i cannot ope to everyone who taps,
and let the draughts come whistling thro’ my hall;
come bounding and surrounding me,
come buffeting, astounding me,
nipping and clipping thro’ my wraps and all.
i wear my mask for warmth: who ever shows
his nose to russian snows
to be pecked at by every wind that blows?
you would not peck? i thank you for good will,
believe, but leave the truth untested still.
spring’s an expansive time: yet i don’t trust
march with its peck of dust,
nor april with its rainbow-crowned brief showers,
nor even may, whose flowers
one frost may wither thro’ the sunless hours.
perhaps some languid summer day,
when drowsy birds sing less and less,
and golden fruit is ripening to excess,
if there’s not too much sun nor too much cloud,
and the warm wind is neither still nor loud,
perhaps my secret i may say,
or you may guess.

i never said i loved you, john:
why will you tease me, day by day,
and wax a weariness to think upon
with always "do" and "pray"?
you know i never loved you, john;
no fault of mine made me your toast:
why will you haunt me with a face as wan
as shows an hour-old ghost?
i dare say meg or moll would take
pity upon you, if you'd ask:
and pray don't remain single for my sake
who can't perform that task.
i have no heart?—perhaps i have not;
but then you're mad to take offence
that i don't give you what i have not got:
use your common sense.
let bygones be bygones:
don't call me false, who owed not to be true:
i'd rather answer "no" to fifty johns
than answer "yes" to you.
let's mar our pleasant days no more,
song-birds of passage, days of youth:
catch at to-day, forget the days before:
i'll wink at your untruth.
let us strike hands as hearty friends;
no more, no less: and friendship's good:
only don't keep in view ulterior ends,
and points not understood
in open treaty. rise above
quibbles and shuffling off and on:
here's friendship for you if you like; but love,—
no, thank you, john.

she stands as pale as parian statues stand;
like cleopatra when she turned at bay,
and felt her strength above the roman sway,
and felt the aspic writhing in her hand.
her face is steadfast toward the shadowy land,
for dim beyond it looms the light of day;
her feet are steadfast; all the arduous way
that foot-track hath not wavered on the sand.
she stands there like a beacon thro' the night,
a pale clear beacon where the storm-drift is;
she stands alone, a wonder deathly white;
she stands there patient, nerved with inner might,
indomitable in her feebleness,
her face and will athirst against the light.

i was born on a tuesday in april.
i didn't cry. not because i was stunned. i wasn't even mad.
i was the lucky egg, trained for gratitude
inside the belly for nine months straight.
two workers welded bunk beds at the end
of the delivery room. one on top of the other.
my universe might have been the white lime ceiling,
or the embodiment of einstein's bent space
in the aluminum springs of the bed above
that curved toward the center.
neither cold, nor warm.
"it was a clear day," my mother told me.
it's hard to believe
there were a few romantic evenings
when i was conceived, a buzz in the retina
and red-laced magma
decadently peeling off
a silver candlestick.
infants' cries and milk fever
turned to salt from the stench of bleach—
abrasive, unequivocal.
with a piece of cloth wrapped on the end of a stick,
the janitor casually extends the negative space
of the black-and-white tiled floor
like a mouth of broken teeth, a baleen of darkness
sieving out new human destinies.2.
1968. at the dock, ships arriving from the east
dumped punctured rice bags, mice
and the delirium of the cultural revolution.
a couple of men in uniform
cleared out the church
in the middle of the night.
the locals saw the priest in the yard
wearing only his underwear, shivering from the cold.
their eyes, disillusioned, questioned one another:
"wasn't he the one who pardoned our sins?" icons burned in front of their eyes,
icons and the holy scriptures.
witnesses stepped farther back,
as if looking at love letters
nobody dared to claim. crosses were plucked from graves. and from each mouth
spilled irreversible promises:
mounds of dirt the rains would smooth down
sooner or later. children dragged church bells by the tongue.
(why didn’t they think of this before?)
overnight, the dome was demolished, instantly revealing
a myriad of nameless stars that chased the crowd
like flies on a dead horse. and what could replace sunday mass now?
women brought cauldrons into the yard.
men filled up their pipes; smoke rose
into the air, against gravity's pull.
nails in worn out shoes exposed stigmata
that bled in the wrong places—
a new code of sanctification,
of man, by man.3.
"read!"—i was told. who said that?
angel gabriel, or my first-grade teacher
who had dark roots underneath her bleached curls? language arrived fragmentary
split in syllables, spasmodic
like code in times of war." continue where your classmate left off!"
a long sentence tied us to one another
without connotation as if inside an idiom.
someone would get to read the noun, another the verb,
a third one a pronoun. . .
i always got the exclamation mark at the end—
a mere grimace, a small curse. a tall cast-iron stove below the portrait of the dictator,
puffing smoke from its temples, enough heat for everyone.
on the blackboard, leftover diphthongs from yesterday or the day before
rubbed against one another like kittens. after dusk, i looked for another language outside the window,
my eyes glued to a constellation
(they call these types "dreamers")
my discovery possibly a journey into the past,
toward a galaxy already dead, nonexistent,
the kind of news that needs millions of years
to reach me. "read!"—the angel shook me for a third time
her finger pointing to an arbitrary word
a million light years apart from its object. (it didn't matter who
was first).
negative space sketched my onomatopoeic profile
of body and shadow in an accidental encounter.4.
language is erosive.
it makes us recluses,
a wind through the canyons
carving our paleontological eras
for everyone to read. under the revised testament of my skin
bellows a gold-cast bull, an alluring object,
a need for attention.
then comes the unleavened bread and a last supper,
which, remarkably, is repeated several times
between ice ages.
lower yet, sodom.
i recognize it from the stench of sulfur. i hold my nose. freud would have done the same.
and then cain,
a crow taught him how to bury his own brother. . .
and at the bottom,
adam’s gentlemanlike sin
under which scientists
discover earlier epochs of famine. between unidentified layers,
wanderings in the sand, the search for a new prophet. . .i try to understand my people.
their language is plain. some words,
were actually never uttered, like pages stuck together
in a book fresh off the press
and long after it sits on a shelf. this, too, lives inside me
within insidious bubbles of air, negative
spaces where i can find little historical rest,
but also where utter ruin may originate.5.
little left of the snow three days ago.
its blanket ripped away, exposing
dog shit and the bruises of routine. negative space gives form to the woods
and to the mad woman—a silhouette
of the goddess athena
wearing a pair of flip flops,
an owl on her shoulder. it’s minus zero. the factory’s gate gnashes its teeth
behind the back of the last worker. blowing noses, shivering,
mucus. . .
a virus circulates through the workplace,
secretly, intimately touching one person after another,
a current of sensuality.
it softens the tone.
but nothing unites them more than their frailty,
the one-sizes-fits-all shoes you must grow accustomed to
by filling the extra space with cotton,
or curling your ill-fitting toes.6.
in halil’s yard,
rules were sacrilege.
his eight children entertained themselves
by carrying famine on their shoulders,
recalling st. bartholomew’s flayed skin.
starving, filthy, hazel-eyed—
three qualities that unexpectedly coalesce
in the bright light, strung together like sneezes. one’s famine was another’s consolation.
“look at them! it’s a sin for us to complain.
they’re even worse off than us!”
but even halil found his own consolation
in the old woman zyra, “barren and paralyzed,”
the root origin of despair. this was our highlands landscape,
hierarchical, where each family
would make out a different expiration date
on the roof below their own.
schadenfreude was the only river
that could turn mills. but if this hierarchy shifted,
and our roof gave signs of ruin,
my mother would plant tulips in the garden,
white tulips, our false image,
a scarecrow to keep predators away.7.
nearly nothing was mentioned in the letters he sent from prison,
just two lines, on top of the page:
“i am well. . .” and “if you can,
please send me a pair of woolen socks.” from them, i learned to read between the lines:
negative spaces, the unsaid, gestures,
insomnia that like a hat’s shadow
fails to shade your chin and ears. and in the photographs’ white background,
acrophobia adds to the color of their eyes: blue,
green, gray, and ultimately, chesnut brown,
as, earthward, we lower our gaze. i learned to read the empty spaces the dead left
behind—a pair of folded glasses
after the reading’s done and discourse commences. or the musical chairs game called "love,"
where there are less empty seats than people.
if you don’t want to be the last one standing
you must predict when the music will stop.
(who, though, has really succeeded?)perhaps a little practice can be useful in this case.
i don’t mean squatting, jumping, stretching,
but listening to the same music every day from the start,
the same miserable vinyl record
so that you’ll recognize its cracks
before it recognizes yours.8.
midnight. snoring,
meaningless sounds that stain the side of the wall
that belongs to no one.
so where are we? what dimension?
who foots the bill at a time like this
without lambs or sinners,
when even angels record nothing? the street’s clearly visible
under the neon 24-hour-service sign
above the funeral home.
there was a music shop next to it
that closed down a few months ago;
the shop shared a wall with the funeral home,
shared the same water pipes and the same gate to heaven.
but the coffins won,
the wide-shouldered coffins that narrow down
in the shape of a mummy, not a human.
wood of the highest quality, swears the owner,
and pure silk inside, pleated like a stomach
that can digest even a bulldozer. when asleep we're simply five limbs. starfish.
if you cut one limb, it will grow back.
even a single limb could recreate us from the beginning,
a single hope.
negative space is always fertile.9.
no one knows if it was simply a matter of mixed
or some other reason why i used to see
what i wasn't supposed to see—
the ending of things.
it wasn’t a mystical gift, but like a blood clot
in the darkness of a vein, i held on to reason,
as it circulated from the bottom up
and not the other way around as we were told.
i used to start from the edges
and with my left hand or a croupier’s stick
gather the balls and dice from the corners
and then watch the bettors
as neither a winner nor a loser.
there's nothing sillier
than watching a film in reverse
where after the climax, the protagonists
are replaced by circumstances,
and circumstances replaced by minor characters,
their tongues plastered behind a single, fatal smirk
life and my short lunar calendar slipped away
like carbon paper sending off as much light as necessary,
skipping the details, the contrast and sharp colors.
lunar time is short. until the actual end,
there are years enough, the negative spaces.
what to do with them when the verb
has already been uttered, a conclusive sentence
with latin syntax, or more than that:
didactic.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
i grew up in a big house
where weakness and expressions of joy
deserved punishment.
and i was raised on the via politica
with the grease of yesterday’s glories,
a thick grease collected under arctic skies.
i was lit up. my notebooks, my hair, my heart reeked of
smoke. that’s when we saw each other clearly.
or rather, what remained of us.
damaged like lottery numbers
scratched away with a blade. how different we were! those with round faces were righteous;
those with narrow faces were cautious.one listened secretly to puccini,
another to silence, the music’s music.
the oldest one declaimed monologues
inside a ten-by-ten-foot cell
he had built for himself. and the mysterious one
simply had diabetes. but how similar we were in severe circumstances! alarmed like a flock of magpies
that the smallest stone sends into the sky
toward the mouth of the abyss. then it became obvious there wasn’t enough space for everyone.
we separated. some went on living in via verbum,
telling of what they knew, what they witnessed,
and so, through their narrative,
creating their own grease. the others crossed over the ocean. and those in particular who went farthest away
never speak of their annoying history
of wretched survival, burying it
in the darkest crevices on their being.
unfortunately, as with perfume, its scent
lingers there for much, much longer.

among the personal objects inside a 2100-year-old chinese tomb,
archaeologists found nine acupuncture needles,
four gold and five silver.
long before knowing why,
ancient doctors knew that pain
must be fought with pain. it’s quite simple: an array of needles pricking your arm
for a properly functioning heart and lungs.
needles in the feet to ease insomnia and stress.
needles between your eyes to fight infertility.
a little pain here,
and the effect is felt elsewhere
once, a group of explorers set out to plant a flag on the south
pole,
a needle at the heel of the globe, in the middle of nowhere.
but before the mission was completed
a new world war had begun.
the impact of the needle was felt in the world’s brain,
in the lobe responsible for short-term memory.
when russia used ideology as acupuncture—a needle over the
urals—
it impacted the pancreas and the control of blood sugar:
america paid tenfold for whiskey during prohibition,
and at post offices, copies of joyce’s
“immoral” ulysses were stored for burning.
the universe functions as a single body. stars form lines of
needles
carefully pinned to a broad hairy back.
their impact is felt in the digestive tract, each day
a new beginning. how can you begin a new day
not having fully absorbed yesterday’s protein?
i was a child when my first teacher
mispronounced my last name twice. that pricked me
like a needle.
a small needle in the earlobe. and suddenly,
my vision cleared—
i saw poetry,
the perfect disguise.

"the wild will keep calling and calling forever in your ears. you

here i rest, in south georgia.

the one before last, “imperial trans-antarctica,” nearly killed me.

18 april 1873
19 august 1939
“shackleton’s
right hand man”
from those cast away here
by a defect in the engine of the ship
or nostalgia of the womb.2.
ah yes. . . in the beginning was the ship. the ship stuck in ice.
endurance. 
ships are women. they prefer soft seas.
in the best-case scenario, she’s called la santa maria 
and she throws you, like columbus, on some foreign shore. but if you get too close to her. . .the very day after
we washed her deck with warm water and soap,
warmed her arteries with gin,
stroked her lower back with our surrogate songs,
shaved our beards and exposed the illiterate lines on our faces,
she took off. and from the shore,
we saw how she broke her ribs, sinking,
aft first, so fast we didn’t even have time to pray,
leaving behind her ash-tree fragrance
and faux pearls on the water. “such a woman!” someone laughed bitterly,
“she knows when to leave so as not to be forgotten.”3.
a woman, naturally, has no business there.
antarctica is a masculine continent—
male penguins keep the eggs warm,
the moon stands up on the street to urinate
after being kicked out of the tavern,
the cold like a cut-throat razor, dulled for three thousand years,
and the sled dogs, the huskies,
we kill with a single bullet
so they won’t starve to death. in this way
we instill a little character into the new land
before the arrival of conquistadors, thieves,
assassins, missionaries, prostitutes,
the first invading army of every continent. antarctica is a man’s continent,
because only a man chooses to break into the darkness of the mind
by conquering the body,
as amundsen and scott did, their glory
reaching to the apex of ecstasy.
zero degree of geographical latitude,
utter collapse.4.
hunger is overestimated. the stomach functions much like the
brain:
when it has nothing to think about, it feeds off memories.
it can last three days just thinking of a single biscuit.
but those who have a better memory, meaning a much stronger
acidity,
can go on for months
remembering a slice of prosciutto, two fried eggs,
sweetly folding their eyelids like napkins after a meal. then hallucinations begin. banquets. easter supper.
feet move impatiently under the table;
the scent of rosemary wafts from a platter
and two clean serving hands with burns here and there.
that's when you feel grief-stricken
and you attack the seals and penguins with your
alpine knives and shoes like a madman
in an empty amphitheater.
or is this, too, a hallucination,
and in this case not ours
but antarctica's? and when clarity finally returns,
both stomach and brain
notice only their own deep wrinkles.5.
blubber, blubber, seal's blubber.
blubber that keeps your spirits alive, rendering it for fuel, for light,
blubber to mask the body's foul odor,
—a mixture of doubt, hope, and ammonia.
and if you have nothing better to do,
think of a cow's thigh hanging at the butcher's,
its delicate streak of fat
like a silk ribbon.i survived even this sarcasm. and every night, before bed,
we read recipes to each other
one of a few things we secretly rescued
from the ship before she sank,
as if these items were her lingerie. what a show it was!
what pathos in pronouncing prosciutto, sugar, omelet!
what sensuality in milk, parsley, cinnamon!
we made these words up ourselves.
nothing exists until its moment of absence. but first, in order to warm up our mouths
like actors before going on stage,
we'd repeat mechanically, palates dry,
"bless us, o lord,
and this food we've received through your mercy.”6.
it was the romans who spoiled the word
studying rhetoric
before anatomy and mathematics: vir bonus dicendi peritus
“the good man skilled in speaking" (marcus porcius cato) but in antarctica, words are measured differently: by calories!
with a simple greeting you lose five calories,
just as many to keep a fire burning for a full minute.
and a ciceronian argument can consume a whole day’s
nutrition;
think carefully before you open your mouth. the word is overestimated. sometimes it’s enough to avert your eyes from your shoes
to imply “gangrene”;
and a vague exchange of glances between men
is enough to understand that the ice is cracking beneath your feet
and death is closer than your fingers.7.
stretched smooth from end to end—such is antarctica. in fact,
even a baby’s skin looks withered by comparison. 
no emotions. no regrets. no warnings.
either fight or die.my father was like this more or less. a teacher at a village school.
in classrooms that smelled of sheep-wool pullovers
drying on the body. and eyes that moved freely
in their hollows, like toes
inside an older sibling’s shoes. unlike the romans,
my father preached about justice and honor
his hands folded behind his back.
his shoulders seemed twice as wide
as his worn jacket. i inherited his sharp, gray gaze
and his soft voice.
eyes that say “go” and a voice that says “stay.”
you never know which one to trust.8.
and mother? oh, she was simply captain cook’s niece,
—the great james cook—
from morning to night
when she washed, swept, dug potatoes from the garden,
fixed her husband’s tie on sundays
even from her bed, while in labor.
she never spoke of this. as it wasn’t necessary.
people speak of what they have, not what they are. she was a tailor. measured everyone's perimeter with a glance;
erred only on the width of one’s neck, an unknown strength.
her large scissors followed
the white chalk line on the cloth so precisely. "snip!"
she said little. her silence followed the white outlines
of another tailor,
over a fabric much older than she was. but now that i think of it,
how did the poor woman respond to her friends asking,
"where is your son?"
"he's exploring the world."
"and what does he bring back from there?"
"himself, alive, i hope."
"what's the point of returning empty-handed after two years?” was she at least a little proud of me? of her frank?
certainly not. she was captain cook's niece.
the past always conquers.9.
i was the first of thirteen children.
and as a rule, each of them
eyed one of my belongings.
one eyed my bed near the window
that overlooked the water where frogs lived
and asparagus grew on the shore.
another eyed my green jacket bought with borrowed money,
poker cards, a fishing net,
my wicker chair with the damaged back.
another whistled my favorite tune:
"what will we do with a drunken sailor?”
without reaching the refrain.
and yet another envied the basement
—that place i occupied in my father’s heart—
with its elm door hanging by a single hinge. but the time hasn't come to leave home just yet,
until your own brother begins to use your shaving kit
and dreams of the same girl.10.
what shaving kit? antarctica makes you grow a double-beard
as if you were a hundred-year-old grave.
and, while you remember wasting time waiting in line at
barber's
another beard grows, a red one. here, each body part works for itself:
the stomach, hands, intestines, eyes. . .
the unity of the body is overestimated, too. only skin pulls everything together like a sled.
the skin? which skin? man loses his first skin
to his first love, like the snake early in spring
on a thorn-apple bush that blocks the way.
from that point on he stops counting the rest.11. 
i don’t know why it was named “elephant island,”
when it answered the ocean with the cries of a she-wolf.
we could only make out her sly teats under her belly. after
some time,
if she didn’t kill us first, we’d begin to cry like wolves ourselves. twenty-two people. packed next to one another under two
inverted boats
like notes in bach’s “come, sweet death, come blessed rest,”
with more pauses, a dramatic suffocation between breaths.
a dry, calcic cough was a sign of life. or the delirious mutterings
of someone
dreaming aloud of “ice” in the middle of ice,
after they had cut off his toes. but the hardest moment arrives in the morning,
when, with shut eyes and plugged nostrils,
as if drinking your own urine
you recycle the same lie for four months straight:
“men, pack up your stuff! the boss might arrive today!” and they obeyed me. packed carefully each day from the start,
leaving nothing shap in the folds of their bags,
nothing that would spoil the line between fact and fiction.it was a time when
routine grew more powerful than hope.12.
fish in the ocean toyed with our citizenship.
on the seventh mile, we left our medals behind, class ranks,
along with the dogs, potatoes, and a camera.
we made fire out of money
and kept only a single metal coin each
so that archaeologists might trace us more easily centuries later.
on elephant island, we had to bid farewell even to tobacco,
tobacco which reminded us of village alleyways
and walks home after midnight. time glided above us without touching a single strand of our
hair—
nonexistent, as if gliding above ancient cities,
exposing the solemnity of our white bones
and crickets on absent walls. that’s when the ten commandments deserted us:
“do not steal,” “do not lie,” “do not covet,”
“honor your parents”. . .
save one of them perhaps,
the one about the holiness of sunday. we already had nothing. we belonged to no one.
an entirely new species: homo antarcticus.
a scientific proof that “forgotten” and “free”
mean the same thing.13.
two years after returning from the world of the dead,
you find your house taken over by another tenant
and the rent tripled,
the commemorative plaque nailed to the gate:
“here lived f.w.”
and your lover, or better, ex-lover,
for the same reason,
in the arms of another
three times more handsome. you see your own image sold at an auction.
artifact. original. “brrramp. sold!” the price so high
you can’t afford it. but even if you could,
you're an illegal customer,
holding a death certificate in your hand. and you find your parents turned into winter trees
their eyes fixed on a large cloud of plaster.
they don’t expect visitors. best not disturb them.
let their leaves fall quietly where they will
let the crow's nest remain in the armpit of a branch,
where it has always been. perhaps you should take a shortcut, start over.
or you know what? there’s a war going on nearby, they say.
go there instead!
but this time die better.14.
war’s never satisfied with flesh;
fresh, branded, smoked,
with or without blood
blue blood, dark, thick, whatever kind.
and frozen blood like yours
could store at minus 40 degrees celsius,
viruses from 1914 unscathed,
and the map of the old empireand scott's hurt ego 
and old coins minted with the head of edward vii,
and browning’s poetry and the epic of the unknown,
like an envelope inside an envelope,
all making you the ideal candidate. back on the ship, ammunition everywhere,
sailing through the cold northern seas
where you had to learn a new language.
a new language is like a fish:
first, you need to remove its spine
in order to chew it. unlike in antarctica,
one’s purpose in war is clear: kill or be killed,
though sometimes it’s the same difference. baltic nights gave you what antarctica refused you:
the other half of the celestial sphere.
you meet vera, the widow of a tea plantation owner,
a character out of a baroque novel, her pupils blurred with dusk,
and the ritual of mourning fitted perfectly to her body
like a final journey. 15.
a man charmed by a glacier,
who knows too well the flawless forms of her body,
feels her eavesdropping gaze even when asleep,
her clean and distant breath
and her heart, a piece of ice, that melts inside a cigarette case
heated for drinking water,
finds it difficult to marry a real woman,
to marry vera.
and africa. i bought land. barren. hundreds of acres. in zululand.
i didn’t fare well with tobacco. planted cotton instead,
chose bodily peace rather than meditation.
my nearest neighbor lived 45 miles away. white, of course.
and my fate, never blended with the blacks,
those beautiful statues, wrapped in straw.
i heard them nod off during lunch break,
like the oars of a boat,
in complete sync.
they knew where they were heading.
but i didn’t. and i was right. it didn’t take long
before drought, floods, worms
destroyed everything. the bank left me only my own beard
and the malarial shadow of a baobab. apart from other things,
vera filled out divorce papers. the woman in the yellow dress,
yellow as quinine, yellow as the sigh of a hinge at dusk,
the woman married to the hero
who now can’t even manage a small plot of land.16.
the man in front of me
—my master i call "boss"—
is newly shaved, and dressed in a striped tie and jacket
as if the prince of wales or fred astaire,
a style that arrives here two years late.
he asks me to serve whiskey to clients at the bar
and chat them up
using their jargon, gestures,
sentences uninterrupted by mosquitoes,
and the abstract rhetoric of the depression years.
and, to be frank,
he pays me for the latter. but what do i know,
what does a survivor know about the art of living,
for which new instincts are needed, new muscles
and other kinds of heart valves? furthermore,
how can i obey such a spick-and-span boss,
having known the smoky gods of antarctica
who recognize each other solely by the nose
and can end rebellions with a glance
and count the deaths as members of the crew?
how can i take orders from a boss whose name isn't shackleton?17.
"second in command,” “lieutenant,” “shackleton’s right hand” what did she see so clearly in me,
my drama teacher in elementary school
when she'd always assign me the role of father joseph,
of gaspar the magi offering jesus frankincense,
or of john the baptist always there to clear the path?
what did she see in my metallic pupils, baritone voice,
infrequent speech
as if scissors, bandage, and iodine
inside a first aid kit? under antarctica's naked sky, each of us followed his own star.
even the carpenter, his own heraldic calling.
you didn’t need much to feed them;
just a few crusts of insomnia and the tents' punctured holes.my star was weak; you could hardly see it
hidden behind another larger, troubled star
like a calm valley that appears behind jagged peaks
more attractive when absent.18.
what happened afterward can be told in a few words:
i worked in a mine; earth’s warm heart,
happened to be crueler than her frozen brain.
i laid railroad tracks south, always toward the unknown.
it was like playing only two strings on a violin: joy and sorrow,
fatefully blending at the horizon. i repaired houses. another waste of time.
i never understood their weak points,
just as you can't make out eyes from genitals or mouth
in some underwater creatures. and when i was left penniless,
i gave lectures about antarctica,
water gurgling in my gullet every five words, for those few
who listened patiently to an adventure of survival. then bea arrived. or sweet beatrice.
it was easy to grant her what i had left in my heart
—that set of heavy museum keys—
with no fear she might lose them. tired lungs and liver
could barely follow my split image
of bust and bottle of booze.
like a prophet in the last circle of dante’s inferno,
i carried my own decapitated head in hand.my ashes were lost at the base of a church. no one
thought of them.
it was a time of war. another world war. the second
one not knowing what to do with her own ashes either.19.
some of us died in the war. others took to the sea again,
the gray, cracked waters of the south,
decks perspiring fuel and alcohol.
our random itineraries. full-time melancholics. for months in antarctica,
we waited for our shadow to return
and consumed that question you ask yourself only once in your
lifetime,
the way one consumes chickenpox. and the rest of the time,
we counted the scars left on our faces,
with a gesture you could call indifferent and epic,
or childlike.

last time i saw myself die is when police killed jessie hernandez
a 17 year old brown queer // who was sleeping in their car
yesterday i saw myself die again // fifty times i died in orlando // &
i remember reading // dr. josé esteban muñoz before he passed
i was studying at nyu // where he was teaching // where he wrote shit
that made me feel like a queer brown survival was possible // but he didn’t
survive & now // on the dancefloor // in the restroom // on the news // in my chest
there are another fifty bodies that look like mine // & are
dead // & i’ve been marching for black lives & talking about police brutality
against native communities too // for years now // but this morning
i feel it // i really feel it again // how can we imagine ourselves // we being black native
today // brown people // how can we imagine ourselves
when all the dead boys look like us? // once i asked my nephew where he wanted
to go to college // what career he would like // as if
the whole world was his for the choosing // once he answered me without fearing
tombstones or cages or the hands from a father // the hands of my lover
yesterday praised my whole body // made angels from my lips // ave maria
full of grace // he propped me up like the roof of a cathedral // in nyc
before we opened the news & read // & read about people who think two brown queers
can’t build cathedrals // only cemeteries // & each time we kiss
a funeral plot opens // in the bedroom i accept his kiss // & i lose my reflection
i’m tired of writing this poem // but i want to say one last word about
yesterday // my father called // i heard him cry for only the second time in my life
he sounded like he loved me // it’s something i’m rarely able to hear
& i hope // if anything // his sound is what my body remembers first.

you can't fake it. you know when i fail
to achieve the expected: palm the becoming-
comatose bullfrog, legs collapsing as they may,
and chuck it (we used to say) high as you can. let it fly stone-like to the skylight in the low
dome of fog—another requirement of the game:
a foggy day and a bullfrog and you, vincent.
the old code goes back and forth between us as we take our turns, childhood pals, engaged
by the game we once called kamikaze—now,
a nameless ceremony. nameless not because
a boy's play calcifies in a man's conviction; not because, despite our promise, you've become
a mid-rank fighter pilot, and i a minor poet;
and not because it's too unpleasant to name
what brings to hand that astonished muscle only to leave it, later, sprawled on the current.
the perfect toss sends the critter shattering
for an instant, beyond fog, into the invisible.
disappearance is success. once you said, "my insidestickle whenever it happens," and so i know
you've been tickled five times, and i three.
that's the score; the score matters little.
the name is gone because we're from here, and, being native, cannot visit how it is
that an urge to which we tend tends to us—
how we are cruel, inscrutable, indefensible,
yet holy. how we send up bodies of praise fromour right hand, only to gather eventual elegies—
flesh stunned still as words—in our left.
once again the center of the heavens
is earth. we've thrown as high as we can for as long as we can remember, only to await
some return: a revelation, plummet, explosive
splash. so it is that two grown men
may stand again in stillness, awaiting word, friends who glimpse for seconds at a time
earth as it is in heaven, ankle-deep
in rowan creek with eyes uplifted,
reflecting the fog to the fog itself.

i look for you early,
my rock and my refuge,
offering you worship
morning and night;
before your vastness
i come confused
and afraid, for you see
the thoughts of my heart. what could the heart
and tongue compose,
or spirit’s strength
within me to suit you?
but song soothes you
and so i’ll give praise
to your being as long
as your breath-in-me moves.
<|endoftext|>

send your spirit
to revive our corpses,
and ripple the longed-for
land again. the crops come from you;

all my desire is here before you,
whether or not i speak of it:
i'd seek your favor, for an instant, then die—
if only you would grant my wish.
i'd place my spirit in your hand,
then sleep—and in that sleep find sweetness. i wander from you—and die alive;
the closer i cling—i live to die.
how to approach i still don't know,
nor on what words i might rely.
instruct me, lord: advise and guide me.
free me from my prison of lies. teach me while i can bear the affliction—
do not, lord, despise my plea;
before i've become my own burden
and the little i am weighs on me,
and against my will, i give in
as worms eat bones that weary of me. i'll come to the place my forefathers reached,
and by their place of rest find rest.
earth's back to me is foreign;
my one true home is in its dust.
till now my youth has done what it would:
when will i provide for myself? the world he placed in my heart has kept me
from tending to my end and after.
how could i come to serve my lord,
when i am still desire's prisoner?
how could i ask for a place on high,
when i know the worm will be my sister? how at that end could my heart be glad,
when i do not know what death will bring?
day after day and night after night
reduce the flesh upon me to nothing.
into the winds they'll scatter my spirit.
to dust they'll return the little remaining. what can i say—with desire my enemy,
from boyhood till now pursuing me:
what is time to me but your will?
if you're not with me, what will i be?
i stand bereft of any virtue:
only your justice and mercy shield me. but why should i speak, or even aspire?
lord, before you is all my desire.

lord of wondrous workings, grant us understanding—now at the hour of closing. a chosen few are called,
their eyes toward you lifting—
they stand exalted in their trembling now, at the hour of closing. they pour forth their souls;
erase, then, their straying—
and grant them, lord, your absolution now at the hour of closing.be a shelter for them
through all their suffering;
consign them only to rejoicing now, at the hour of closing. show them your compassion,
in your justice turning
on all who brought oppression to them—now at the hour of closing. recall their fathers’ merit
and count it as merit for them;
renew their days as once they were, now, at the hour of closing. call for the year of grace—
the remnant flock’s returning

i’m waiting for a poem,
something rough, not elaborate or out of control,
something undisturbed by curses, a white raven
released from darkness. words that come naturally, without aiming at anything,
a bullet without a target,
warning shots to the sky
in newly occupied lands. a poem that will well up in my chest and until it arrives
i will listen to my children fighting in the next room
and cast my gaze down at the table
at an empty glass of milk

my throat wrapped in silver

prisoners
guilty or not
always look the same when they are released—
patriarchs dethroned. this one just passed through the gate
head bowed despite not being tall
his gestures like a bedouin’s
entering the tent
he carried on his back all day long. cotton curtains, stone walls, the smell of burnt lime
take him back to the moment
the cold war ended. the other day his sheet was hung up in the courtyard
as if to flaunt the blood stain
after a wedding night. faces tarnished by sun
surround him, all eyes and ears:
“what did you dream of last night?”
a prisoner’s dreams
are parchment
made sacred by its missing passages. his sister is still discovering his odd habits:
the bits of bread hidden in pockets and under his bed
the relentless chopping of wood for winter. why this fear?
what can be worse than life in prison? having choices
but being unable to choose.

we lived in the long intolerable called god.
we seemed happy. i don’t mean content i mean heroin happy,
donkey dentures, i mean drycleaned deacons expunging suffering
from calcutta with the cut of their jawsi mean the always alto and surely anusless angels
divvying up the deviled eggs and jello salad in the after-rapturei mean
to be mean. dear lord forgive the love i have
for you and your fervent servants. i have so long sojourned lord
among the mild ironies and tolerable gods that what comes first to mind
when i’m of a mind to witness is muriatic acid
eating through the veins of one whose pains were so great
she wanted only out, lord, out. she too worshipped you.
she too popped her little pill of soul. lord if i implore you please just please leave me alone
is that a prayer that’s every instance answered? i remember one wednesday witness told of a time
his smack-freaked friends lashed him to the back of a brahman bull that bucked and shook
until like great bleeding wings the man’s collarbones exploded out of his skin.
long pause. “it was then,” the man said, “right then…”
yes. and how long before that man-turned-deacon-turned-scourge-of-sin
began his ruinous and (one would guess) holy spirit-less affair? at what point did this poem abandon
even the pretense of prayer? imagine a man alive in the long intolerable time
made of nothing but rut and rot, a wormward gaze
even to his days’ sudden heavens. there is the suffering existence answers:
it carves from cheeks and choices the faces we in fact are;
and there is the suffering of primal silence, which seeps and drifts like a long fog
that when it lifts leaves nothing
but the same poor sod. dear god—

somehow, i am still here, long after
transistor radios, the eight-tracks my father blared driving from town to town across ohio
selling things, the music where we danced just to keep alive. i now understand i was not
supposed to leave so soon, half a century a kind of boulder that i’ve pushed up the hill
& now for a moment, like sisyphusi watch it roll.
i walk through the snow. i breathe the dirty east side wind
pushing past the russian church, the scent of fish & freighters & the refinery
filling the hole in my chest—how many years have piled since i last stumbled out onto the ice
& sat down to die. only to look up at the geometry
of sky—& stood to face whoever might need me—

when is a poem one word? even at 17 he was baraka
on the court, coltrane gold toned, a kind of running riff,
more than boy-child, man-child, he was one word like prince.
how back in those drunken days when i still
ran in bars & played schoolyard ball
& wagered fives & tens, me & my colleague
the psych-prof drove across eastern ohio
just to see this kid from powerhouse st. vincent,
grown out of rust-belt-bent-rims, tripped
with the hype & hope & hip hop
blaring from his headphones, all rubber soled
& grit as the city which birthed him.
we watched him rise that night scoring over 35,
drove back across the quiet cut cornfields
& small towns of ohio, back to the places
where we slept knowing that jesus had been reborn, black
& beautiful with a sweatband crown rimming his brow.
he was so much more than flipping burgers & fries,
more than 12-hour shifts at the steel plant in cleveland.
more than the shut-down mill in youngstown.
more than that kid selling meth in ashtabula.
he was every kid, every street, every silo, he was white
& black & brown & migrant kids working farms.
he was the prince of stutter-step & pause. he was the new
king. we knew he was coming back the day after he left
his house in bath township. he never sold it.
someone fed his fish for years. perhaps our hope? fuck miami.
leave wade to wade through the hurricane rain. lebron is
remembering that woman washing the linoleum floor, that man
punching his punch card. he drives a camaro, the cool kid
ohio car driving through any main street. he is the toll-taker, &
he is the ticket out.
he keeps index cards documenting
his opponents’ moves. one leans forward before he drives.
one always swipes with his left hand. the details like a preacher
studying the gospel. he studies the game like a
mathematician conjugating equations, but when he moves he is a
choreography,
a conductor passing the ball like a baton. he is a burst of cinders
at the mill. he is a chorus of children calling his name.
the blistered hands of man stacking boxes
in sandusky, the long wait for work in lorain.
a sapling bends
& reaches in all directions
before it becomes a tree. a ball is a key to a lock.
a ball is the opposite of glock.
america who sings your praises,
while tying the rope, everyone waiting for caesar to fall,
back-stabbing media hype city betrayed
by white people with racist signs.
i watch the kids play ball
in the heights, witness this they say. we will rise. i watched
lebron arrive & leave, i walked, i gave up drinking
as he went off & won a ring. the children’s chorus calls out sing
brother, sing. everything is black. storm clouds gather
out on lake erie. but the old flower-hatted women
at the baptist church are heading out praise cards,
registering teenagers to vote. to turn a few words into a sentence.
he is a glossary of jam, & yes he is corporate
chugging down green bubbly sprite, running in beats head
phones, he is dunkin his donut, he is nike, witness, ripped.
on a spring day in akron a
chorus of children is chanting his name on the court by the
chain-link fence. he is forged steel, turning his skinny body into
muscle, years of nights lifting, chiseling, cutting, studying.
watching the tape. to make a new kind of sentence. he is passing
out t-shirts, this long hot bloody summer he was returned
to the rusted rim along the big lake. he is stutter-step. he is
spinning wheel. he has a cool new hat. he is speaking of dead
black children. he is giving his time. to make the crowd
sway like wind through a field of corn.
does lebron think of dying?
does the grape think of dying as it withers on the vine by
the lake? or does it dream of the wine it will become?
he is wearing a shirt that says i can’t breathe.
they said he was arrogant. i said he was just ohio.
he married his high school sweetheart. bravado laid out
on the court. no back down, he is biggie with a basketball inside
of a mic, no ballistics, just ballet. he is miles davis cool,
quietly cerebral, turning his back, tossing up
chalk like blue smoke, blue notes, blues. he is akron,
columbus, he is heart & heat turned to lake effect blizzards,
freighters frozen in ice, looking for work & no money to eat.
he is ashtabula & toledo. he is carrying so many across the
river, up through marietta.
the grapevines are ripe in geneva.
he returns, man-child, man-strong, man-smart, man-
mountain, mansfield to east akron, minus into man, or should we
say mamma raised? single mother fed, shy child, quiet child
who grew, who suffered & taught his body to sing, his
mother worked how many shifts, doing this, doing that,
never gave up for her son. he is third shift at the rubber
plant in winter, he is farm hands & auto parts piecework
& long nights the men at the bar, eyes on the television.
the lake tonight is black as newly laid asphalt.
there are no ellipses. he is turning paragraphs
into chapters. long ago the hoop gods made this deal
at the crossroads, old scratch is flipping the pages
of his program & waiting high in the stands—to belong to a
place most people would call
nowhere, to show the world how tough we truly are,
twelve-hour shifts at the rubber plant in akron. how he is, how
he is a part of this asphalt court we call ohio, & how we
suffer, & how we shine.

cordoned-off spines: he has been granted

he is docile, eager to please, leads me
up the stairs and takes me to the bed. the coverlet is authentic, he says.
he lectures me on the heating system, offers

all of the welty lore he has rehearsed.
she taught him when he was young, and now
he serves her legend, lets me lean in
toward the books—i cross the line
of what’s allowed, never touching.
he shows me photos—two loves lost, one
a married man—then on the way down,
pauses before a feather in a box,
reciting yeats’s “leda and the swan.”
he begins to weep at let her drop, adds, like welty’s loves! now i stop—
is he comparing her to the god, or leda?
he cannot bear her, her unfulfilled love.
i cannot bear this either—how dare he conjure up
for her such disappointment, such wasted longing?
i want to be the mirror of her photographs,
to be her figure of my own conjuring. i want
to believe i, too, could be happy here, in this
solitary house, in this small town, amidst
the rows and stacks of books. untouched.

when you walked in
it was like recognizing the moon when he returns.
his lover bites his cheek; she has no choice. all we see
is the dissolution, then await the reconstruction.
each time, the sky yanks her into his orbit.
i want to say i’m sorry. i want to say you win. our bodies are like the confessional booth these
poems are stuck in. even the priest can see that sin.
you’ll be all spit and honey—or maybe i’m the poisoned
flower gnawing on its own lip because it has no hands
to reach for you. only words that are as useless as the pollen
for saying anything. i continue to serve them even with your hands
around my throat from across the room. your voice is home,
i answer it like a bat guided across the atmosphere. this
is a narrative that cannot end well but wants to, but must.
i’ll continue to go down kicking and you’ll be sweet as anything
until you bite back. no, it can’t end here—we won’t let it.
billions of years have passed since an asteroid last hit
the moon: clearly some magnetic fields can be sustained.

when you asked if it rained bees or poison
you were asking the wrong question. again. you still didn’t understand the difference
between hurricanes and flooding. thus between gods and humans. between your slum-
lordy digs and the shacks i pass that cling to old boards and huddle around each family.
the yards marking the care of home. everywhere something is falling on
someone and i watch like an autumn tourist tripping through the berkshires.
i reach to catch a leaf. i try to straighten a pisa-like sapling. the wind wraps around
us both like a question mark and leaves me standing, the sole witness on this end.
i’m telling you about a place of silence. you want it all to be a metaphor. i’m watching
a front porch crumble. still, someone sits there.

serious smiles a lot.
at least that’s what they say,
his mum and pop
trying to be proud
as all the nurses gather round
to squint into the cloud
of little serious on the ultrasound. it’s likely just the way he’s bent,
the head nurse finally thunders
into the awe and argument
swirling through the crowd
where someone mutters half-aloud in all my years…serious never hears.
serious spins and spins
with his dumb dolphin grin
in the best bed there is,
where there’s no guilt and no sin,
no child more inner than this;
nothing to will
and nothing to want,
no body you both are and haunt;
no drug of disappointment
or feeling that there’s never now
(or do these seep in somehow?);
no suffering the world’s idiocy like a saint its pains;
no traffic and no planes;
no debts, no taxes,
no phones and no faxes;
no rockslide of information
called the internet. serious isn’t. yet.2.
serious hears a sound.
not unusual, in itself, nothing to be concerned about.
here and there there’s been a shout,
a song he seemed to be inside,
the weird whale-calls of her gas.
this, too, shall pass. then it comes again,
and with a far-off force
which a shrink less serious than he
will have him dream is a drain
that all his impurity
is slowly drifting toward(down, serious says, down!) 
beyond which he’ll be clean,
feel no pain…then the dark erupts in a rain
of blood and muck
he seems to mostly be,
holding on for all he’s worth,
which isn’t much, finally,
little wizened thing
plopping out to an earth
where cries of agony
dwindle to equivocal joy(it’s, it’s…is it a boy?) 
and some clear world lies
just beyond the eyes
you can’t quite open; and everything is wet,
and loud, and broken;
and all of life is one huge tit
you’re meant to somehow suck.s erious staggers to his feet,
slaps himself harder than the doctor did
and says, i’m fucked.3.
serious is learning silence
in the way most children learn to speak. poshlust!
he gasps after his first feeding, götterdämmerung in his first dusk,
his whole body writhing with a kind of violence
as if the world had wounded him,
words his bleeding.
anomie, deus absconditus
drift into the air above his crib; accursed progenitor, quintessence of dust
dribble with the pap onto his bib;
as day by day, and week by week,
serious wrestles with this difficult gift,
forgetting, which, it seems, he is on this earth to do.
boob, ass, oaf,
riving out of him like greatness going off; ninny, crackpate, clunkhead, gorm,
leaving him gasping and bent; fragments, sheep, rabble,
all falling, falling from him
backwards into babble...finally serious lies there, spent,
language like some immense ghostly mobile
bobbing just above his bed,
all power of movement gone as well: useless little buglike arms, buglike little fingers,
this heavy, heavy head. and now if there’s something serious can’t quite taste,
or if he feels too acutely his own waste,
or knows too acutely what he can’t tell,
he screams and screams
until the world knows what serious means.4.
serious goes to school. just try it, his mum says
as she lets go his hand
and wipes a last glaze
of doughnut from his nose,
and serious, insofar as serious can,
does give it a good try,
though it’s hard to understand
why they keep taking a break
from taking breaks, or why
they can’t simply walk
in line down the hall,
or what, finally, is at stake
in a game of kickball. it’s time to draw a tree.
what a relief to work alone,
serious thinks, as he picks a scab
for just the right tinge of sky,
breaks his sugar cookie
to make a place of stone,
and fashions out of bread
a man with a huge head
and huge, ruined wings,
gasping at all the ruined things
to which he’s tumbled.
and calls it: cookie, crumbled.
oh my, the teacher says
when she walks by, those are interesting trees. 
serious closes his eyes and sees
as in a vision of doom
himself drowning in schools,
a whole ocean of fools
nipping, nipping at him
with their tiny, tiny teeth.
and serious sighs
with a prophet’s wisdom
as he climbs up into his seat,
stares out across the room
and like a prophet cries: you’re all going to die! the class is a tomb.
serious, rigid, waits.
a girl in pigtails giggles,
then another near the back.
and as if along a fuse
the giggling goes
up and down the rows
till someone makes a crack
about his coat and tie
and the laughter detonates. serious climbs slowly down
into that inferno of sound
which the teacher’s shouts
are only driving higher,
packs up his lunchbox, his dignity,
and his copy of sartre, and strides with a prophet’s gaze
through all that derisive fire.
only once does he turn,
briefly, to look back through the blaze
at the iron fact of his art,
smaller from here, but unburned.5.
serious loves his mum.
and then he doesn’t, quite.
it’s that way with everything—
baths and plums,
the blessèd silence of night.
would you like to help with this?
his mother asks
as she rolls out biscuit dough
and cuts it with a glass
or folds the clothes
still warm from the sun.
but serious knows
he was born with a task,
and though he touches the clothes
and tastes the dough,
serious says, no. serious stays in the bath
until his skin is shriveled and cold,
eats himself sick on plums,
feels in the dark
the dark he becomes,
and cries out in the night for his mum.6.
serious is older now.
he just is. thank god, serious says,
for whom childhood, that stupid carousel that never stops,
always had an element of disingenuousness:
the tristesse of lollipops,
the sham of naps;
fools dandling you on their laps
so you can play horsey, which damn sure isn’t serious;
and all that endless business
of pretending to be curious
about the most obvious things:
what’s night? where’s mama-cat?
what’s wrong with pop? can god die?
why, why, why? to hell with that,
serious thinks, as he sits incinerating memories
one by one,
saying their names as he feeds them
like photographs to a fire:
here he is in a baseball uniform
squinting back the sun;
here in a blue tuxedo with a ruffled front;
and here, lord, with pimples.
he pauses a moment.
do memories have names?
and what, exactly, are these flames?
to hell with that!
done. serious owns a car, pays taxes,
contemplates a pension,
has a crease of gray along his temples,
but he is young, young.
he develops headaches, begins sleeping badly, and relaxes,
you might say, into the constant tension
that he really always was,
with far, far too much to do
to look anywhere but onward,
or to answer the questions of a child
with anything true.7.
serious isn’t stupid,
though they go to the same gym.
serious sees him dropping weights
or picking his butt and thinks,
at least i’m not him.
nor is he mean or vain,
those chiseled twins
with matching boots and belts,
nor smug who notes their sins,
nor shallow noting something else;
he isn’t useless timid
who no matter what won’t complain,
nor fat-assed nice sweating honey
on all the machines,
nor self-loathing who smudges mirrors,
nor whacked who licks them clean.
serious isn’t funny. serious spreads his towel on the bench,
sits down in front of his own image,
and serious strains at a serious weight.
and never, not once, when he’s seen
in myriad mirrors around the room
that everyone else is straining too,
has he caught himself too late
and finished with a roar
and more strength
than he’s ever had before: i am not you!8.
serious has a date with doom.
it’s not the first, and seems unlikely to be the last,
for they get on quite well, doom and he,
share similar pasts
and similar ideas about what life should be.
it seems, in fact, that this might just bloom. and what a relief.
after morose and mad and neurotic;
after almost falling for grief,
who was so exotic
she made all the others seem tame.
then to discover she even lied about her name.
and to sleep with another serious! that was odd,
like wrestling with an angel,
though it was hard to tell from that rough unsated tangle
which one was serious, and which one god. but how easy it is to be himself with doom,
serious thinks, as he puts the wine in to chill
and sets two glasses on a tray,
who always wants whatever serious wants
and always agrees with what he has to say;
who doesn’t need to hear that whole spiel
about “going too fast” or “needing more room”;
and who doesn’t probe and pry that long needle into his brain
—what do you feel? what do you feel?—
until it’s all serious can do not to stand up and scream: pain! lucky to be alive.
and if he still has no clear idea where she lives,
and never knows quite when she’ll arrive,
still, something about doom feels right
to serious, and he looks forward to their dates.
he checks himself in the mirror, dims the light,
and waits.9.
serious is a traveler.
“traveling broadens the mind,”
the man beside him says,
his tray table down and seat reclined
even as they're taking off,
and serious, who has his eyes closed
so he can do what serious does,
begins to cough. what do they say, what do they fear, 
is this song joy or grief? 
this is a man, this is a god. 
who are you and why are you here? 
to leave, to leave. the meal is over,
which serious declined.
in the shell-roar of the cabin
he eases somewhat, is surprised to find
he could almost drift away.
“what line of work are you in?”
he hears the man beside him say,
and serious begins coughing wildly again. what is that smell, what was that sound, 
isn’t that ice on the wings? 
this is the air, there is the water, 
but what do you do on the way down? 
you scream, you scream. how far they must have gone by now,
that old familiar world miles behind,
the man eats an orange,
and now he eats the rind.
he eats his plate, his plastic fork, chews
with animal relish his styrofoam cup,
leans over to eat bittersweet serious too,
who startles and wakes up. look at the desert, look at the green, 
is there an end to that ice? 
here is a place, and here is a place, 
but what is the space between? 
it’s life, it’s life.10.
serious is married.
what a weird wind this is,
he thinks, so still at times,
then stinging the eyes to tears.
and how he seems both more and less
himself, and how it seems at once all of loneliness
and something he can hold.
or is it he who's being carried?
he shivers, and reaches out for her again.
or is it she who reaches, she who's cold?
what is this wind?
where are these years?11.
serious experiences loss.
just like that.
flat.
serious experiences loss, as if he’d come to some sheer cliff
there was no way around,
no way to cross,
and found,
on the other side
of a deep canyon, himself,
experiencing loss. serious, when the man is gone,
tells himself that he tried,
tells himself that he cried and cried
for all he was worth
to the man sitting on the other side
experiencing loss,
who one day simply vanished, or moved on,
or slipped off the edge of the earth
and died.12.
serious doesn’t speak french.
this embarrasses serious,
because insofar as he lives anywhere,
serious lives in paris. he feels the city stare,
feels himself sweat, and shake, as he tries to wrench
the little that he’s gleaned
into the lot that he desires;
feels shopkeepers look at him as if he were a liar,
waiters as if he were unclean; and feels, in truth, not at all serious,
as if he had a huge balloon for a head
and helium squeaks for a voice,
as if gravity could be merely a choice
he were making, and he might instead
simply stop, let go, and drift away. finally serious, opposed to epiphanies,
has one he can’t resist.
he is serious, and to be serious
is to know something utterly or not at all,
and to know, moreover,
that as you let your half-knowledge fall
from you, it does not exist. just like that serious is himself again,
saying weighty things
about the flowers in the stalls,
pondering a splendid mirage
called the seine. and if he wakes saying fromage,
or in some shop feels
right on the verge of translating please,
serious knows it’s a dream,
and knows from childhood what to do.
point and scream
until the damn fools give you cheese.13.
serious has some culture.
he knows some things.
and if, as he begins to speak,
he should feel the immense wings
of ignorance shadowing him, that dirty vulture
that squawks in drawl and drips tobacco juice,
serious knows what shelter to seek. pick a name and bach is better.
modernism was powerful but diffuse.
life’s drained out of pictures since the renaissance.
technique! technique! technique!
and about all that spastic flatulence
called contemporary art,
well, serious hardly knows where to start. serious sits through opera without a yawn,
chews up books on which weaker teeth would shatter;
he can tell you where one brushstroke lies,
list the reasons courtly love is gone,
pluck the speck of subject matter
from henry james.
serious knows some things. he thinks and thinks and thinks
until his ignorance shrinks
to the tiniest of flies
alighting somewhere in the louvre.
carefully, carefully, serious creeps
with his massive swatter,
saying, don’t move. don’t move.14.
serious believes in nothing.
it’s a nice day, what should we do?
what are you thinking?
what’s been bothering you?
what’s that you’re drinking? serious spreads the paper on his lap
to confirm what’s new under the sun,
hears a tap, tap, tap 
against the windowpane.
nothing ventured, nothing gained,
floats up from childhood like a bit of ash,
and serious, pausing, can almost see
his old preacher, that atom bomb of idiocy
who every sunday would explode.
still, serious thinks, there’s a truth to set you free.
but who could survive the blast?
tap, tap, tap. serious skims the sports pages,
reads about a storm that rages
far out at sea.
some talking dog is taking office,
some country wiping out monuments, expunging its past.
tap, tap, tap.
goddammit, serious says, midway through a war,
and thinks again of that old bore
who talked and talked and talked
until you felt your head loll and sway
like some huge flower on a tiny stalk
that one good breeze would break; and how you’d see him afterwards eating chicken fried steak,
chicken fried man,
with a tiny transistor radio in his hand
so he could listen to the football game;
and how his face seethed and writhed with what seemed pain
if he saw you coming to his booth,
and he stared off as if some great truth
were finally, finally coming clear in that chicken fried brain
and like a prophet he was going to stand up and shout—
until what plopped innocuously out
was your own name.
tap, tap, tap. serious puts aside the news of the day
and walks to the only window there is.
but there’s no wind, not even the grass stirs.
and anyway, there’s no tree.
serious shrugs and turns away.
must just be me.13.
serious sees a child
in the playground across the street,
sees his huge stupid head and huge stupid feet
as he tries to keep up with the games,
and hears his sonar screams
of delight amid the other children's screams,
and hears his timid weeping when they call him names. serious sees the child standing apart sometimes
driveling to himself in silly rhymes,
and sees him pretend to look intently at the sky
if serious walks by,
or sees him simply stop and stare. gradually serious starts seeing the child everywhere,
in a store standing in an aisle,
in the subway while
serious is trying to work on the way home,
or laughing with his family in a restaurant
where serious eats alone. serious knows the truth.
this child wants something, his whole nature is want.
and it begins to be annoying,
this novice cringing, all the imbecilic and cloying
tactics of being cute,
the whole hangdog way he has of panhandling pity
with his freckles and his missing tooth,
sitting all fidgety in his sunday suit
or babbling happily as he’s leaking snot; and then the air he suddenly puts on of being serious
when it’s so obvious he’s not. serious sees the child in the playground
standing to the side,
sees his face whiten and his eyes go wide
as serious crosses the street and strides
until his shadow swallows the child
and leans down close enough for them to kiss. i don’t have time for this,
serious says, i’ve got too much to do. and the child says, who are you?16.
serious kills himself.no, no,
shivering out of a dream,
starlight and the hard glitter
under the bridge’s beam,
serious, serious,
don’t go. serious crawls out of bed,
feels the cold in the floor
and thinks, suddenly, of lovely mad
(where can she be?)
who’d bolt out of sleep and scream farmers get up at four!
it’s three. serious makes himself a cup of coffee,
which he doesn’t drink;
tries and fails to read,
tries and fails to think.
serious sits, and holds himself still,
minute by minute;
until the dawn finally comes
and he is in it.17.
serious lives alone.
it’s better this way, he tells himself,
as he takes a pan from the pan shelf,
a spatula from the spatula drawer,
and fries two eggs the way he likes them:
yolks of stone.no more gnats of chatter over breakfast.
no more breakfast. it’s noon.
no one prancing by with only panties on
when he’s almost, almost broken through,
or singsonging outside his door serious, o serious, where are you?
no more! but what, finally, does serious do?
he sits, ignores the ringing phone,
looks at a wall
on one of the last warm days of the year,
and settles back into the lifelong call
of being serious,
which is to see, within that whiteness,
leaves being gently blown,
and to feel their colors as they fall.
serious gives a speech.
he sets his papers on the podium,
his glass within easy reach, tap, tap, taps the microphone.
how vast this venue is.
how absolute this darkness.
to be serious is to be alone!
serious cries out with a triumphant look on his face,
waiting for the echoes to end
out there in all that space,
which the words at once define and extend.
it takes a while, but they do die.
the spotlight lasers in.
he blinks hard, starts again.
to know in every hand another’s touch, to hear a silence words only intensify, to feel not too little but too much this attenuated world—serious begins to sweat,
feels the back of his shirt grow wet;
looks down to see his papers swirled
and scattered, the glass on the floor, broken.
what’s with this fucking light, he thinks,
or was it spoken?
he glares out at the dark, impassive crowd
and as if by force he could make them wake
hears his voice growing loud:
whatever you most treasure you will break, whatever you hold closest you will let go, there is no place that you will not leave! but to be serious—
serious says,
quietly now, because he has them, they are his—
to be serious, to be truly serious, is to know that what you call your losses you cannot grieve, for it was never quite these things that you wanted—this treasure, this touch, this one place—but by such life to be haunted. brilliant!
no notes, no flaws.
serious stands back and waits for applause.
the hall is silent, utterly silent,
the heat tropic. serious looks around, confused,
turns to the man who introduced him
then can’t remember being introduced;
and even given his credentials,
this suddenly seems a most unlikely topic. serious tries to get out of the light,
but the light goes where serious goes.
he blunders to the edge of the stage,
a cliff
breaking off into a dark
in which there's no movement, no voices, not one sigh. serious feels the rage
draining out of him, and feels a chill, and whispers, where am i?
serious nears an end.
it’s cold and getting colder,
and serious, older,
sits outside thinking of his good friend,
who like so much of serious is gone,
and thinking of that godforsaken dawn
after the one night of his life he spent outdoors.
tell me,
his good friend said
when serious staggered out to the fire, which form would you say is higher, tragedy or comedy? and serious, who had stumbled full-bladdered
in the night from a dream of bears,
then dreamed himself the object
of a dozen hungry stares,
who had swiveled, pissed into the tent,
and sworn such things it would take a life to repent,
serious, exhausted serious,
was silent.
because it’s been troubling me, serious, that the answer can only be tragedy.to be conscious is to be conscious of losing whatever it is that you most love, and thus an art that's truly greatwill always have one deepest truth to tell, which is, my friend, this life is hell. serious looks at the sky. it’s late.
a small wind blows
the trees, and serious, shivering, knows
he should head inside,
that he is not well.
but sitting here, letting his eyes close,
serious can almost see that lake
aflame with the early sun, and smell
the sweet burn of that wood,
and feel the way it seemed his heart would surely break
were it not for the strange lightness in his head
as his friend smiled and said, but maybe earth is the heaven of the good.
serious talks to god.
there’s no one else left.
his mind is mash,
his world is ash,
and serious occasionally forgets himself,
though he is not, not bereft,
that sniveling idiot two doors down
who sits up late
with only ashes in the grate
and talks to god.
see? serious says. see? nothing.
serious spreads his arms magnanimously
as if to give god the floor.
god declines. thou know’st the first time that we smell the air we wawl and cry,
serious says, louder than before. and then we wawl and cry some more, and then we die, and then we rot!
again he waits in case
there’s disagreement. there’s not. serious scoffs, goes to brush his teeth,
forgets briefly to avert his eye
from the mirror’s glare
and finds his father there, that gentle baffled man
who, when there was no hope,
when he couldn’t even stand,
carved from a piece of soap
a silly yellow duck
and set it in a little yellow dish.
serious feels a tingling in his hair
and mutters something close to a prayer, i wish, i wish...the lights go out. goddammit, serious shouts
as he trips and falls
to his knees on the floor,
banging his head on the door
as he tries to rise. goddammit! serious cries. the lights come on.
his father’s gone,
but there, at the edge of the sink,
balances the little duck in the little dish
no serious person would ever keep.
serious tries to think,
steadies himself as if at some brink,
decides he needs sleep,
that’s what he needs,
crawling fully clothed into his bed
and pulling the covers to his chin
because, it seems, there’s some strange wind that’s somehow gotten inside.
so unlike serious,
to leave a door unclosed. yet here it is, gathering strength
as it blows his books
on the floor and it blows
right through his body and it blows
behind and below and above
and out of the whirlwind a voice cries love
what? serious says, as he tries
to sit upright and looks
wildly around him,
raising his fist in the air. the things...i have lost—immediately he is tossed
back against the wall
by the force of a storm
that has no source, no form,
and hears again the call
out of nowhere: love
my god! serious screams,
unable to help himself, what maundering politician, what decerebrated pop star, what stupid puling poet couldn’t tell me that? 
struggling to get out of bed
he starts to cough, then choke,
a riot in his heart,
a riot in his head
as he falls off the edge to the floor. who do you think you are, 
he gasps. is this... is this some sort of joke? suddenly the strange wind is quiet,
but no less strange the calm that comes after.
i’m serious, the voice says. and serious dies of laughter. epilogue
the dead man’s famous.
no one now remembers him alive,
or knows his name, or anything he did.
still, a few stories survive
after all this while
of a weird-looking man
with a weird-looking smile
that had, it’s said,
almost a kind of life to it,
though the man was seriously dead. and some remember how all the flies
vanished for miles;
and some say no, no, but the buzzards had weird smiles
as if they knew something.
and some tell of an old woman
who would come and whisper in the dead man’s ear,
and smooth the dead man’s hair,
and if the door opened, disappear.
there are even stories of that grim mortician
who thought the smile undignified
and tugged and tugged so hard
he slipped and fell inside
right on top of the dead man,
whose lips, he swore, seemed to soften,
seemed to somehow kiss.
and some remember this:
before the lid was sealed on that coffin
and the nails driven,
there were on that face real tears.
and some say he smiled like a man forgiven. the dead man never hears.
the dead man spins and spins
with his dumb dolphin grin
through all the places where he is
when people talk of him again:
in classrooms or in planes,
in boredom or in pain;
in front of screens
or in the spotlight’s glare;
in days too mild to bear
and in the long nights where
the dark grows steep,
the wind wild,
and a mother rises from her sleep
to calm her serious child.

it is not pain that holds me back, but time
with its sad prefigurations and smell,­­­
its flowers and echoes, rivers and crime.
even now, without a future, i tell
myself lies in future tense. as my hair
thins, i collect combs. when clocks chime, i groan.
the falling world finds pleasure in despair
because to suffer means to be alone,
and i suffer through all the accidents
of change as though i were settling a score,
as if to disinvent what death invents.
i once built a castle, now i do chores.
to pass the time i rearrange my things.
to fall asleep i recite names of kings.

love of air and water
joined in apprehension,
perhaps you know what's there
by way of fear, for while living in pursuit of
and going always forth
toward something that trembles.
its knowledge is your mind. what do you think about
the great ocean's sullen
aristocrats—these small
headaches and dark affairs that bathe themselves in your
staging grounds, where you go
to contemplate how what
you want became your mind? the black oblivion
offers no reprieve for
you, hunter—in its keep
your ears have grown too sharp, so sharp you almost hear
your own heartbeat over
the subtle whispers of
water’s dismal gardens. everything about you
is overblown, even
your mouth is uniquely
talented at its tasks, gathering for slaughter
animals in their sleep,
speaking without a sound.
noah had seven laws, you have only one—eat
to build life out of death,
survive above all things.
the fatalistic moon filtered down upon you
seems an imitation
of lives you will not live.
would you be its hero? would you call out against
the morning’s weaving light
that shames the night before
the passing of its cool? would you be at the beach
when the invisible
becomes a glow, to surprise?
inland, workers dreaming of unitarian
proposals lose no sleep
to fear about your mouth.
it is their wayward friends, who wandered too far west
into fevered chaos,
that wake up with your name
as screams exploding dreams. the inland ether holds
clouds in your dismal shape.
lucky are those who know
nothing, who cannot see hell outlined in vapor.
somewhere a piano
plays a sorrowful song
half-written by the hate that a grieving loved one
would stick into your heart.
such are the arts of men.
beware. your time is near. someone has learned lessons
you didn’t mean to teach.
a crowd is gathering.
your skull is their kingdom.

you hold onto life like a hostage. you're deeply embedded.
you're an actor slipping into a new script. you're a comma
whose purpose is to mark the moment when prose is suspended,
where begins a poem's pensive silence or some dark drama. you're a charles dickens character in the opium den
of a long life. all you want is to sleep through the nights after
satisfying intercourse, but your mimesis may have been
caught by sexually transmitted diseases. disaster is an evening when you're so hungry every apple core
evokes grocery stores. being the only one and only,
they can't clone or disown you. the only thing you lack is your
adult teeth, beneath the rotten teeth of what makes you lonely. and the truth is that devolution concurs with disposal
till it emerges, when entourage lobbies for decalogue,
and hype is the new preparation before its proposal,
calling for the removal of all shoes, shirts, and demagogues, and the zealous anti-orientalists who refuse to
use anyone's last names first when denying them service at
the sperm bank, where the preferred euphemism is "super glue."
remember the joke about the butcher who couldn't get fat? rejuvenated vaginas and enhanced penises squeak
thanks to puritanism gone gaga vis-à-vis bling-bling
à la bada bing. people piled up form a sexual peak.
two condoms put up their dukes inside a contraceptive ring. champagne is the new organizer for your political
campaign to conceive something tantamount to fasd
of the spirit. were you surprised or did you wax critical
when you emerged from the driveway to your domesticity without any disease but your family's questionable
cultural history? is it such a mystery that your
mediocrity's latently poised to emerge? that you're full
of traditional vulnerability? you'll pace the floor until you face (at a number of paces proportional
to the gravity of the insults that have been thrown your way)
yourself dressed like a clown. your brain will halt to urbanely sprawl
and then catapult your past beyond your future like a claypigeon across a clear blue sky, toward a lemonade stand
at which the theory of other minds attempts to explain
why petroleum prices fluctuate with body count and
meaningful relationships end in kaleidoscopic pain.

described by anything. because i could not mean anything else,
she knows exactly what i mean. once upon a time a line saw itself

praise shared disdain. praise space made by connective

at the dinner table; polite conversation;
lies you push through your teeth. because dissecting
a dog's heart won't change the way it thinks. praise redirected
traffic. praise the gnarled lip that defends
the gentle bones. because your mother was
a seahorse. and to think of her thin is

for alma band a goddard my cynical feet ambled
prepared for indigestion
& blank faces of outrageous innocence
knowing i'd have to walk over years of media
declaring we're vanished or savage or pitiful or noble
my toes twitched when i saw so few brown faces
but really when one eats racism every time one goes out one’s door
the appeal of talking about it is minuscule
i sat with my back to the wall facing the door
after i changed the chairs to a circle
this doesn't really protect me
but i con myself into believing it does
one of the first speakers piped up i'm only here because my friend is black & wanted me to do this with her i've already done 300 too many racism workshops
let it be entered into the book of stars
that i did not kill her or shoot a scathing reply from the hip
i let it pass because i could tell she was very interested in taking
up all the space with herself & would do it if i said a word
they all said something that i could turn into a poem
but i got tired & went to sleep behind my interested eyes
i've learned that the most important part of these tortures
is for them to speak about racism at all
even showing up is heresy
because as we all know racism is some vague thing that really doesn't
exist or is only the skinheads on a bad day or isn't really a crucial problem
not as important certainly as queers being able to marry
or get insurance for each other
when they turned to me as resident expert on the subject
which quite honestly i can't for the life of me understand
or make any sense out of
i spoke from my feet
things i didn't know i knew
of our connections
of the deadly poison that racism is for all of us
maybe some of them were touched
but my bitch voice jumps in to say not much!
i heard back that someone thought i was brilliant
does that mean that i speak well
or that she was changed
it's only her change

my knees have a life of their own bending
as if my very existence depended on it,
and it does, for i’d rather be a nut flying high
over people’s heads than on the ground dying
touching the earth, staining the water
with my unclean mind, my hands washing red
off the money so i can sleep off my power trip
and back stabbing toys.
i was an old soul at five spouting off
about the filth of my generation.
i knew greed was the root of all evil,
competition in close cousin.

 white-mexican looks like a latina,

a question
from a guatemalan student
who's come undone
in my esl class,
doesn't get my kind
i try to describe
how i grew up
in caucasian corn country
surrounded by houses
on cul-de-sacs
that all looked the same,
how we were alone
in a town of 5000,
one black family,
one indian family,
one asian family,
and one household of mexicans,
no two, us and the renterias
to whom we were related by marriage
before and after my divorce,
and they were mixed;
still, it was a good living,
happy in our cocooness,
our oneness,
separated by money
one direction
color on the other:
classes, classes, classes,
day and night
we took lessons:
piano, jazz, tap, ballet,
the dance team, trumpet,
trombone, tennis, finishing school,
and one awful summer golf;
christened, confirmed, cathechismized;
it all cut me in several places,
molding of head and heart
making me ultrasensitive,
then and now,
an observer of the outside,
an outsider among my own kind,
my very shade,
mysterious aloof
black haired beauty
who can't speak spanish,
living among blue eyed dyed blond bombshells,
who held up her head higher
because she's shy not stuck-up,
understood, undenied, sacrificed to at any price
by my beloved little brown parents
who taught me well
gave up so much
so their daughters could shine
and they'd swell with pride
at the life they had given us,
on sundays we basked
in mutual admiration after mass
singing our church songs while making breakfast,
according to the unspoken doctrine in our house of:
fast first eat later after communion,
we intruded with our mexican music
bellowing out the open windows
the smell of bacon frying,
pancakes baking, coffee
and eggs scrambled to order
it wafted out on beautiful summer mornings
out of our house in pleasant hill, iowa,
perched on the highest spot
one could reach on the east side of the street
for first and second generation immigrants.january 25, 2001

after a winter of gluttony & grief
i'm back on plan for good this time.
i’ve ballooned to a specific kind of ugly the kind you hope to hide
with body spray. but it gets worse
after a winter of gluttony & grief. i’ve shown up for meatballs. for lemons
whipped to weeping. now i land my balloon
for the specific kind of ugly salad oil is. happy date night, darling.
happy coconut water + nutritional yeast.
after this winter of gluttony & griefspring comes, stabbing her hard stem
of anger in the throat. even garlic scapes
are flat balloons, their ugliness specific as my penmanship: green tubes of spice
& hate. my body speaks the ugly testament
that took all winter. it says: gluttony & grief balloon, darling. only kindness is specific.

it's true: i have it
though i hardly approve
of anything it does. supposed bend of light
or smudge where two odd
angles cross. i hardly see—can hardly do a thing
with it. white zone of
no flesh pressing into no. so low, i can’t
scale or measure it. i used
to think: ok! a clean sharp place
to keep. or: i'll grow a thing! to keep, for me! but
no. it's just a ward to mark & mount, a loop
i lope around with, so
i count myself a realm
of realms. i vote & vote.
turns out, we agree with everything we
do, almost. we sweep
the precincts of ourselves: the rooms
between each rib
& under them till we reach the fat
red condo where
our blood leans in. we live here now. half
heart, half townhouse.
come on down. turn on that sweet tv.
our mise en place, our rugs
& nooks: we’re full of stuff. we paint
the furniture we couldn’t
live without. it’s true at last: we have it all
though we hardly know
what any of it does.

long cords of fusilli to remind you of my hair

woody herbs burning our tongues—it’s a holiday
i conjure with my pink-and-green gloves wrangling life from the dirt. it all turns out

i still see those men haphazardly standing
around the comps’ floor, mostly silent,
lost in their latest urgent jobs,
looking up and down as if nodding yes from what they call their composers’ sticks
as they set inverse words and lines
of each page that could be taken for
greek scripture, declaring: in the beginning was the word and the word
was made cold type and the word was
coldness, darkness, shiny greyness
and light—and the word dwelt amongst us. oh, i know these men would laugh this off.
they’d say, if they simply didn’t throw
their eyes to heaven, that they were just ordinary
characters trying to keep the devil from the door, and with luck have enough left over each week
to back a few nags, and go for a few jars.
but they can’t say anything or set anything now.
they are scattered from that place that’s not the same any more and many have left
any place we know of in this life,
calling to mind the old names for printing: the mysterious craft or simply the mystery.i set them up in another city, another country
that’s as far away in distance
from that city as it’s far in time.
but they are still composing, cracking the odd joke above
their sticks and galleys on some floor
of some building that is eternally busy
inside me even when i’ve forgotten that i’ve forgotten them; forgetting
the world behind the word—
every time i read the word world i wonder
is it a typo and should i delete the l.*now again i hanker to know the quality
of each letter: the weight, the texture, the smell,
the shiny new type, the ink-dark shades of old,
the different types of type, the various sizes within the same font, the measures in ems,
picas, points and units. i’d set the words up,
making something out of all this
that stays standing—all set as masterly as the words those men set that reveal
something of the mystery behind
and within these letters and the wonder and
the darkness, but with the lightest touch.
and the umpteen ways things can foul up
are beyond telling. maybe the type is off,
or the typesetter may not be up
to the work, if only out of a hangover setting an ! where there should be a ?
or a b where there should be a d,
or miss a space or a line or dingbat.
and the proofreaders don't catch the error, passing the copy on as clean, or the make-up man
fouls the assembly page, or the stoneman errs
as he fastens the page of cold type and furniture
with the chase, turning the quoin’s key.*not to speak of the evil eye cast by
fellow composers ready
to knock the words of others, or the bosses
writing on the composition: kill. old shades, keep my words from such eyes
and fretting about that pied world and let me go
on regardless. and even if i foul up and the stewards
are right to set kill on my last page and my words are distributed and thrown in the hellbox,
the real achievement will be that i tried to set
the words right; that i did it with much labor
and not without a font of love. but that said,*grant me the skill to free the leaden words
from the words i set, undo their awkwardness,
the weight of each letter of each word
so that the words disappear, fall away or are forgotten and what remains is the metal
of feeling and thought behind
and beyond the cast of words
dissolving in their own ink wash. within this solution we find ourselves,
meeting only here, through the mystery,
but relieved nonetheless to meet, if only
behind the characters of one fly-boy’s words.

of your ma, the time capsule of this printout,
hurling and whirling towards us, it’s all daft
on this earth. our alien who art in the heavens,
our martian, our little green man, we’re anxious
to make contact, to ask divers questions
about the heavendom you hail from, to discuss the whole shebang of the beginning and end,
the pre-big bang untime before you forget the why
and lie of thy first place. and, our friend, to say welcome, that we mean no harm, we’d die
for you even, that we pray you’re not hereto subdue us, that we’d put away
our ray guns, missiles, attitude and share
our world with you, little big head, if only you stay.

me once on the train into the mountains
on the journey to the shore, a time long ago when
we spoke and never met. that secret, which is ours.
some nights are so long the old dog comes home
to us who remain there waiting and waiting
even if we’ve never been here before, where we are.

if you care about yourself at all, come to your own aid while 
there's still time. 
marcus aurelius 3.14citizen of rome, you are the center of the universe.
problem is, circumference is—take a guess—me. “some things are impatient to be born
while others are impatient to die.” don’t say i did not warn you. next time they swear
shit happens, pop them square in the nose. this will not help anybody, but helping is
the farthest thing from my imperial mind. if you keep your spirit blameless and pure
people will drape you with laurels but no one will have sex with you in backseats
or marble mausoleums or anywhere else ,a small price to pay for honor and respect
though not for me, being an emperor with no clothes. just pretend today is the last day of your life
and act accordingly—not that such strictures apply to yours truly, sports fans.
the forces of evil march on the fortress of your self. i wish i could explain why.
but what if evil did not exist and what if your self was no fortress, see what i mean?
stoics get a bad name. not in touch with feelings.
too rigid. know-it-all cocksure mothers.
so the stoics retain pr firms, don’t tell a soul. if you really knew what was good for you,
and you do, why do you care i’ll flail you alive? true, pissing off your emperor is a poor plan,
even one like me mounted bare-assed on a steed. once upon a time, children…the story peters out.
circus revels and gladiatorial raves—seen one, seem them all. life is tiresome,
when will it end and will we ever notice? i wish i knew. really, i wish i cared.
my pal, marcus aurelius, natters day and night: “living is more like wrestling than dancing.”
guess he never saw me take molly at the club. and he says we always have the option of
having no opinion. right. like he knows. ok, then, where did i put my pants?

#1 [college]we packed your satchel with sweatshirts,
soccer equipment, and the elements of style,
loaded up the hum vee, a sad drive to jfk
and the cross-country flight to starting college,
where fortunately due to advanced placement
courses you’ve already been awarded your mfa
and published your first book.
as we pulled out of the driveway, i slammed
on the brakes, and not on account of jubilation,
the neighbor’s cat. “stacey,” i said, “we have jumped the gun.”
“i didn’t know we had a gun, pops,” you said.
“this is a figure of speech, a melonaphore.
but you can’t go to college yet,
stacey, you’re barely by my count five years old.”
“that’s all right, daddy-o, nice try.
but my name’s not stacey.”#2 [puppy]love this puppy and your love will be repaid.
i can’t stress how little this will teach you about life.
which it will. which is a lot.
sometimes, when you’re sad, i won’t know what to say.
desire will cut into the bone.
so much we need to cover before you’re on your own.
this is a tea kettle, where goldfish won’t feel at home.
when i was your age, before you were born,
a war was almost certainly about to break out.
the russians turned out to be just like us,
only worse drivers, which is a lot like us, too.
i had a pet once, too, you know. an accordion.
very tough to train, stained with fluids as it was
about which nothing further need be said.
your questions matter. no, they really do.
i have no clue as to the white carnations,
no reason to suppose the stars were not meant for you.#3 [fish]“do fish sleep?” i am so glad you asked. once
upon a time fish did not even catnap.
childhood has reached a certain point.
more specific than that, i cannot be,
or less. when you drive to chartres
you can see it coming at you far away.
never pass up a cathedral if you can.
drink lots of water with the strawberries.
leap before you look too hard, which makes
things swim in your head, like fish that never sleep.#4 [birds…]“time’s come to talk to you about the birds.”
“and the bees?”
“what do you know about the bees?”
“was just asking.”
“a falcon is one bird you can’t keep in a cage,
i can’t explain why, though i might point
to history for many instructive precedents.”
“you have trouble explaining, dad.”
“anyway, what i like about birds is, they’re much
like dreams—they fly in through a window
where you didn’t know there was a window before.”
“i get it. we open to the known and discover
mysteries left in their place, like putting under the pillow
a tooth that fell out and you come up with the cash
when you need it in the morning, for school.”
“let’s stay focussed, amy.” “sure, reginald.”
“i mind it that you call me reginald, who’s he?”
“someday, dad, i may fall in love.”
“let’s go back to the birds. i don’t want to say
love is for the ornithologists, though such thoughts occur.
maybe the real topic is experience.”
“i knew that.” “when?” “you told me.” “i never.”
“didn’t have to.” “that’s how, you just know?”
“life’s a vale of tears, pops, except when it’s not.”
“hence, sweetheart, some birds thrive in cages.”
“name three.” “i want you to try on some wings.
i want you to take flight. like the day i gave birth…”
“what?” “the day i gave birth to you was the day of days.”
“you feeling ok?” “the epidural worked like a charm,
i felt like i was swimming in air.” “i think you’re confused.”
“i wouldn’t be the first, but when they handed you to me
you nursed till you fell asleep.” “you’re talking about love.”
“and some bees sting.”#5 [bond]once we had a bond, a sacred trust.
i carried you on my shoulders, we watched
the finches dart and feed, i read the odyssey 
to you, which ok was a stretch, but who cared
you did not exist? certainly, not me.
but take the example of homer.
would you just give me a chance?
there’s an old dog called argus
who waits for the hero to show before he dies.
i’m getting to the point. if we never had a dog
i would wait for you to arrive from a journey
forced upon you by chance and fate.
you see, the whole thing’s about waiting.
there you are off-stage readying yourself
for a grand entrance into a life none of us
heretofore presumed. i myself ache
barometrically in concert with the coming storms.
if you never are, i have something left over
even if it’s only me, watching you wade in, as if
you were a great swimmer and this world another shore.

i found my father’s favorite swiss army knife
in a box he sent me with no note,
just james bond videos,
nothing else.
what was the message? the message was there wasn’t one. this world violent, full of sex,
the movie’s zeitgeist, era after era, a new bond
double-o-seven-ing in. divorced dad sundays
at the greenwich watching
the british secret service save the world. i thought he sent the knife inadvertently,
but now i see it was code—he was boxed in
without a knife
to cut himself out.

prologue willy loman’s reckless daughter flies quietly, fluttering like a silk-moth behind me
blocking my life, my scenes in whichever stage direction she wants.
sometimes at night i can feel her dialing into me, her ringing calls like an imperial decree.
when she sleeps she crashes, like a carinto the guardrail of my ambition.
her curse like a poison i cannot smell, an asphyxiation of the self by the self, that hell and hard sell.
split personalities, we dream through the night, of our merger and acquisition, in her half-moon light,
not even my husband can feel her there between us—a secret contract under seal.
when i awaken, her irises touch mine; an awful, indecipherable fault line.
she’s a character in search of an author, a devotee, trying to recount her history through me,
until i channel her. she’s like a phantom limb, hymn to the invisible. her shameless whims,
the subtext of my lies. under her tinted hair the forest murmurs, becomes a thought, or prayer.
until her thoughts tumble into mine; colors bleed. in the morning, i’m overwrought—
my patrilineal kin, she begins to wear thin, when she undoes hospital corners i’ve tucked so gently in.
her cool white rising is meringue completing—the high-pitched silence of our congealing.
she was always ceremonially unfolding his white shirts, unpressing the folds
in my circumstance. i did and didn’t want her. i kept trying to catch her, then let her slip. any intent
to have her near made her more invisible. her electric breasts overfilled my brassieres. an interaction, our dialectic—
she never removes her hat upon entering the door to my personality. ma semblable, ma soeur!

as the father turns away from the thought
of his failure, the hands remove
his glasses and rub his eyes over and over, drying the nonexistent tears.
unknown to the one who is troubled
about losing his hair, his fingers stroke his baldness as he speaks. the body,
our constant companion, understands
the loneliness of the hostess in her dark driveway, embracing herself after the guests
who promised more and soon have gone,
and even visits the old schoolteacher who reads the same happy ending to each
new class, working her toes in her shoes.
how could the people of the kingdom not have known the curse of sorrow
was nothing more than a long sleep
they had only to wake from? in dreams the body, which longs for transformation
too, suddenly lifts us above the dark
roofs of our houses, and far above the streets of the town, until they seem
like any other small things fastened to earth.

in the apparent
vacancy beyond
each line, you might
sense the poem waiting to think
itself. imagine
the surface of a twilight
pond in wind, shifting and changing
the sky, then
going still
as a concentrating mind, the far trees
deepening
in its reflection.
like the poem the pond’s alive—
its beauty (the sudden
scintillation of a hundred
thousand wavelets)and music (the percussion
of a beaver’s tail)
arising from what is.
and when the pond accumulates
the darkness,
which it loves,
it challenges your eyes to find the light
that without darkness
you could not see.
wild campsites you never noticed
now appear
along the far shore.
it’s not only itself the poem waits for
moving line by line
into its own dark.
it waits for you.

it must be difficult for god, listening
to our voices come up through his floor
of cloud to tell him what’s been taken away:
lord, i’ve lost my dog, my period, my hair,
all my money. what can he say, given
we’re so incomplete we can’t stop being
surprised by our condition, while he
is completeness itself? or is god more
like us, made in his image—shaking his head
because he can’t be expected to keep track
of which voice goes with what name and address,
he being just one god. either way, we seem
to be left here to discover our losses, everything
from car keys to larger items we can’t search
our pockets for, destined to face them
on our own. even though the dentist gives us
music to listen to and the assistant looks down
with her lovely smile, it’s still our tooth
he yanks out, leaving a soft spot we ponder
with our tongue for days. left to ourselves,
we always go over and over what’s missing—
tooth, dog, money, self-control, and even losses
as troubling as the absence the widower can’t stop
reaching for on the other side of his bed a year
later. then one odd afternoon, watching something
as common as the way light from the window
lingers over a vase on the table, or how the leaves
on his backyard tree change colors all at once
in a quick wind, he begins to feel a lightness,
as if all his loss has led to finding just this.
only god knows where the feeling came from,
or maybe god’s not some knower off on a cloud,
but there in the eye, which tears up now
at the strangest moments, over the smallest things.

of vessel, vial, capsule, hull, a tiniest nil
fires the neurons from their swooning stall,
is not a healing but adaptation to same
a quickening in deleting of sensation
a prior sizing. stacked leaves (green shadows)
are givens in the columned garden, what work is needed
to determine that shape? some hysteric
trope of repetition, rage for accretion,
dazed by its own mute replication,
like the minute lines of a hand. they are
its cries (writes ponge, among others),
the tongue inseparable from its utterance (langue).
we weep to hear it, a language forgot.
i was saying i keep speaking
from some chamber sound deleted, which is why
i never call or write. in that theatre are many eclipses

wherein revolve astonished birds, and the queen of night
sleeps a rest restorative and profitable, and

with a mournful but driving feel, in bm, 2/2 time in the dark, in the bitter wind
listen to a dream
grandmothers stand
shoulder to shoulder, on the rim of a hill
bend as one, and grasp one thing together
ask them, in the dream world, why
do they cry? they will show you in reply
their shawls of many colours, spread these wings
sweep you in, teach you how
once a year, in the dark of the year we wash
the whole world in a day—for one day, we cry until they're home, until they all are home 
from one dawn to the next mourning
for the broken wailing for regrets
love lost, wrong words, wrong actions
unbalanced moments and all the cracks between heart
and heart, parent and child
lover and beloved friend, nation and nation
creature, and creature of another kind
for what we choose and what we neglect to choose
for what we wish we'd known
for each hand unclasped tongue unbridled
one whisper falling short of heard until they're home, until they are all home 
the bread far from
the hunger the apology
the confusion the broken road these things we gather in this blanket
bone and sand and sage
we wash the world, between us
hold this blanket, fill it with our tears
and when we have cried
from one dawn to the next
then we will rise, and we will dance until they're home, until they all are home 
lay your hands upon the truth of beauty's loss
heavy, soft as moss, this blanket
full of tears and dust and dying
becomes ocean cradle, healing, dark
the promise, washed clean by our sorrow
today crying out, as we're birthing tomorrow
not so much redemption
as the law of moon and season
calls for justice
one day, the lawmakers must
exit their echoing halls, fall in
with the grandmothers dancing
carry it cry it clean until they're home, until they are all home 
until light through their bodies
translates to rainbows hung over the land
until light through their bodies
translates to rainbows strung over this land
until light through our bodies
translates to rainbows shining over our land until we're home, until we all are home

george bernard shaw
the ferry furrows
the foam,
leaving a wake
that quickly settles
and forgets us,
as it has forgotten
all those
who’ve opened these waters:
fisherman, monk, pilgrim and pagan,
some foundering here.
our mainland
world diminishes.
there is respite.
a cloud engulfs us
out of nowhere
as if the miraculous
were about to appear.
the veil lifts
to reveal the small skellig
and skellig michael
rising like chapel and cathedral.
we forget speech, hypnotized by the climb,
concentrating on narrow, rock-hewn steps
that spiral up like the gyres
of the book of kells, whirling in labyrinths
of knowledge, turmoil and eternity.
they lead to the beehive huts and oratories
packed with a congregation of sightseers
who whisper in disbelief and reverence
at how those sometime monks lived
in this wind-tugged cloister of shells. we browse in each dome’s live absence
and picnic above the graveyard
that’s no bigger than a currach
with a crucifix for helmsman
navigating his crew to the island of the dead.
we’re eyed by the staunch, monkish puffins.
our tongues loosen, but, in keeping
with the somberness of this sun-haloed place,
we chat about the world with an earnestness
that would embarrass us on the mainland. you tell of medieval monks charting world maps
with countries drawn as humans gorging upon
each other’s entangled bodies. we go on to
the lands and demons of the world of poetry.
i’m flummoxed when you ask what poetry is.
i recall how the earliest musical instruments
were hewn out of bones, and that poets
carve their words out of those gone before.
they are the primitive musicians who beat
and blow words back to life. more than that i don’t know.
that dusk at dún an óir we slaughtered even
the pregnant, whimpering women methodically
while a bloodstained sun drowned in the ocean.
each fetus struggled in the belly
of each slain mother as desperately
as a lobster dropped in a boiling pot.
had shed blood been ink, i could still be
quilling the faerie queene, but i did not
allow a drop to blot a mere sonnet
that you, trapped in complicity, can never
quite break free of. admit it, hypocrite!
in your time few are not guilty of slaughter.
even the page you’ll pen this upon is of pine
that amazonians were shot for. i could go on.
(edmund spenser)
i lifted the pitch of my grief
above the storm-lashing waves
for my world breaking on the reefs
of foreign, land-grabbing knaves, who ignore dependence upon
the lowliest plants and creatures
as the hermit crab and cloak anemone
depend on one another .but no matter what, you must
keen for the world’s theft
as i keened mine, despite knowing
soon no one may be left. (aodhagán ó rathaille)
lend an ear to one of your own kind
and do not let yourself be caught
by the winds of lust, like dante’s starlings
blown this way and that by every gust. i myself was borne on this wind
as i rode across country,
always wary that around the next bend
my life would catch up with me.
my rakish ways squandered energy
that i should have instilled in song,
more worthy of the muse-gift given to me
than my odd aisling, pay particular heed to me, especially
since your word-talent is less than mine.
i’m still too bushed to eke out a last line.

of art’s blood
as he lay slain,
already becoming cork mud. sing as full-throated
as my unmatched plaint;
matching my words
to his cold body
that would never again
rouse to my touch.
my hands wept
that day’s icy rain
as i swore to undo
that kowtowing
dribble of a man
who slew my art
of the winged white horse. the spirit of that mare
i rode fleeter than any hare,
fleeter than any deer,
fleeter than the wind

i sang not for my own or for beauty's sake
as much as to keep our spirits fired, 
knowing as long as we sang we'd not break, 
refusing to allow the country be shired.
but it was too much when even our lands
turned hostile and drove us like lapwings
in the hard winter, together in dying bands,
our swollen bellies pregnant with nothing. 
even the birds seemed to give up singing. 
so i lay down and relinquished song.
but i should have kept up my amhrán-ing, 
adapting and transmuting their tongue.

make something right out of what's wrong.

sensing few mean hurt, 
though when forced to tussle
they'll show their worth. 
so learn from me. 
when i come to mind
don't recall how, feisty, 
i knocked nests of words
over the edge,
splattering on the rocks 
the crude squwaks of other

 it was a vertical time. it was the expression, a spirit giving way onto an electric barren. we
circled and were encircled and had no cause. it was a time of the self come on in a field of
apparatuses. it was vignetted by sleep, and the sleep was in its center breached. cold moving
through the smell of gas. the big-leafed enclosure. it was a time that clattered at the horizons,
whose recounting was already foreclosed, as in a numeral smudged in powder, as in a thin water
making of the atmosphere a disc. it was a time of guzzling. a time amid what has been kept, a
time of calendered trust, repeated appeal, erasures of flight. we begin with a weedy stem drawn
against the winter sky. dear hierophant, our decision initialed. the muffled sound of the closet
and the machine.

i broke at last
the terror-fringed fascination
that bound my ancient gaze
to those crowding faces
of plunder and seized my
remnant life in a miracle
of decision between white-
collar hands and shook it
like a cheap watch in
my ear and threw it down
beside me on the earth floor
and rose to my feet. i
made of their shoulders
and heads bobbing up and down
a new ladder and leaned
it on their sweating flanks
and ascended till midair
my hands so new to harshness
could grapple the roughness of a prickly
day and quench the source
that fed turbulence to their
feet. i made a dramatic
descent that day landing
backways into crouching shadows
into potsherds of broken trance. i
flung open long-disused windows
and doors and saw my hut
new-swept by rainbow brooms
of sunlight become my home again
on whose trysting floor waited
my proud vibrant life.

in the middle east pontius pilate
openly washed involvement off his

talking of apostles that other fellow
judas wasn’t such a fool
either; though much maligned by
succeeding generations the fact remains
he alone in that motley crowd
had sense enough to tell a doomed
movement when he saw one
and get out quick, a nice little
packet bulging his coat pocket
into the bargain—sensible fellow.

(for niyi osundare) something in altitude kindles power-thirst
mere horse-height suffices the emir
bestowing from rich folds of prodigious turban
upon crawling peasants in the dust
rare imperceptible nods enwrapped
in princely boredom. i too have known
a parching of that primordial palate,
a quickening to manifest life
of a long recessive appetite.
though strapped and manacled
that day i commanded from the pinnacle
of a three-tiered world a bridge befitting
the proud deranged deity i had become.
a magic rug of rushing clouds
billowed and rubbed its white softness
like practiced houri fingers on my sole
and through filters of its gauzy fabric
revealed wonders of a metropolis
magic-struck to fairyland proportions.
by different adjustments of vision
i caused the clouds to float
over a stilled landscape, over towers
and masts and smoke-plumed chimneys;
or turned the very earth, unleashed
from itself, a roaming fugitive
beneath a constant sky. then came
a sudden brightness over the world,
a rare winter’s smile it was, and printed
on my cloud carpet a black cross
set in an orb of rainbows. to which
splendid nativity came–who else would come
but gray unsporting reason, faithless
pedant offering a bald refractory annunciation?
but oh what beauty! what speed!
a chariot of night in panic flight
from our royal proclamation of the rites
of day! and riding out our procession
of fantasy we slaked an ancient
vestigial greed shriveled by ages of dormancy
till the eyes exhausted by glorious pageantries
returned to rest on that puny
legend of the life jacket stowed away
of all places under my seat. now i think i know why gods
are so partial to heights—to mountain
tops and spires, to proud iroko trees
and thorn-guarded holy bombax,
why petty household divinities
will sooner perch on a rude board
strung precariously from brittle rafters
of a thatched roof than sit squarely
on safe earth.

skirting streetlight and the dissolving moon. wing mirrors tell

is so small and manageable. i think of an old song,
of purple cows in far fields, i wonder what it’d take

with no maps or destination.it is not easy anymore to forget or be free of the bear

in a twelve square metre room
with the thuds of tennis balls
the only music tells me
that suffering

than healing and i wish
to cover all territory

bed linen, your bland skin with the pattern and fear of all my dots—
by the old wharf on naoshima

just a festering colony of the mind: these shuddering trees

leaving work one blue august evening. hell’s

at the top of a hill each morning,
i wait for the bus by the donut store.
its pink sign looks hot,
curls, like a rope, a stem to a brain.
you turn toward a jade
at the height of your neighborhood,
stop at a light in its gut.
the sun starts to seep up,
reaching all grasses and grooves of the city.
a white bus with black windows passes.
a few minutes later, the city bus arrives like a room.
it crawls warm and dull to the west edge,
breathing its heat, a few baby hands
warming wide glass.
the billboard at my stop displays a large number to call.
a man walks his sniffing dog below it,
sharp legs brushing wild onion.
at the base of the hill,
i enter my code,
push the gray gate open,
allow the worn loop of my bag
down my arm, walk to my station.
i drop the metal end of a hose
into a bucket, turn the tough faucet.
traveling after the sound,
the cold rushes out
full force from the rubber,
breaking into itself, interrupting and filling
the round plastic space.
hungry, i pick up the water.

flow. so long as you teach your children these words they will remember
as well. this we cannot allow. one hundred and sixty acres allotted.to each elder unable to till or hunt—so long as your old and injurious habits
sing out over the drum or flicker near the fire you cripple our reward. we
seek to hasten your end. eighty acres allotted.to each widowed wife—so long as you can make your mark, your land

to your favored white sister. eighty acres allotted.to each full blood—so long as you have an open hand, we shall fill it with
a broken ploughshare. one hundred and sixty acres allotted.to each half blood, each quarter strain—so long as you yearn for the broken

when every acre of your allotment has been leased or sold, you will turn it

as they stretch their legs
on the way home
from yellowstone or yosemite
and the byway’s historical marker
beckons them to the
site of an indian village—where trouble was brewing.
where, after further hostilities, the army was directed to enter. 
where the village was razed after the skirmish occurred.
where most were women and children. riveted bramble of passive verbs
etched in wood—
stripped hands
breaking up from the dry ground
to pinch the meat
of their young red tongues.

finding myself in a mesmeric orientation,
before me appeared benjamin franklin,
who magnetized his french paramours
at dinner parties as an amusing diversion
from his most serious studies of electricity
and the ethereal fire. i like thinking about
how he would have stood on tiptoe to kiss
their buzzing lips and everyone would gasp
and clap for the blue spark between them.
i believe in an honest and forthright manner,
a democracy of plain speech, so i have to
find a way to explain i don’t care to have sex
anymore. once i was a high school teacher
and there was a boy who everyday came in late,
who only came to school at all to sell drugs
out of his backpack, upon which he laid
his head like a pillow and closed his eyes
while i pointed at a chart diagramming
the anatomy of a sparrow. the vice principal
was watching and taking notes as i taught
this class, so i slid the bag from under
his cheek, as if not to wake him, wrapped
his fingers around a pen. i was trying
to be a gentle mother and also trying
to show i was in control of an unstable
situation. the boy, also trying to be
in control of himself, walked so slow
to my desk and we stood to watch him
push everything—binders, piles of ungraded
papers, a beaker of red pens to the floor.
he was so calm. how do you like it when i touch your things. i do not like it. i live
in a house with many blue mason jars,
each containing a feather collection or starfish
collection or vertebrae collection, and also
there is a fully articulated fetal alligator skeleton.
each window is pressed by the design
of a sweet-gum branch, all the little orange
and red stars of its leaves, you can’t see
the perfect geometry this close, just haphazard
parabolas, but beneath the foundation
the roots mirror the branching. i have
a chart of this to pull down. the view is flat
and so quiet on the inside. have i been
forthright yet? what i want to know is
what happens if i decide to never have sex
again? or more precisely, can i decide
to not have sex again and still be kind?
and be a joy to others? i should mention
i am a wife. i should mention i was told
my sole purpose is to be joy to others.
the sidewalks outside are very full of people
and when i look at them i feel hopeless.
benjamin franklin was so jolly with his kite
and his key and his scandalous electricity.
he was so in love with women and drink
and democracy. before i was this way,
i was not a house, i was just a jar and what
i wanted was to be broken. a cool trick
you can do that i once showed a class is crank
a wheel covered in felt against another felt
wheel. static bristles and sparks and makes
your hair stand on end. but hook it to
a leyden jar and the electricity fills up
in there, invisible as air. becomes a glass
battery, until you too much the thing, then
wow! broken glass everywhere. i remember
wanting that. do i have to always want that?
my house is blue and quiet. i can hardly
hear the squirrel in my sweet-gum tree
dancing like a sunbeam to sing his riddles:
“a house full, a hole full, but you cannot
gather a bowl full.” the air of everywhere
is wet with electric fluid, you can’t even tell,
but pop, whiz, everywhere. “in this
field,” ben says, “the soul has room
enough to expand, to display all of her
extravagances.” the sweet gum has 10,000
sticky, spiky seed balls. they start green
but grow black and fall for want of
a barren season. they look like sea urchins.
i call them tree urchins and think it’s
a funny joke. i don’t tell it to anyone,
as i am tired of being told what is not.
such a secret, i know, is an extravagance,
and i like best how it’s an extravagance so
small you must keep it in a jar with others
of its kind for it to ever mean anything at all.

my child is sitting cross-legged on the floor reading to herself.
sometimes she is so full of need i push her to the floor.
only once i did that and i don’t even remember the moment
right, but i was trying to wipe urine off my leg and she was
naughty like a squirrel and jumping and singing and her head
slammed into my chin, which hurt and even more than that,
it pissed me off, because she’s my beautiful child, but in that
button snap of a moment she was suddenly just one more person
and i pushed her away in a way that felt to me like setting her
down, but awkwardly, because of how she was also balancing
her feet on my feet as i tried to pour out a bowl of pee
from her little potty as a toothbrush dangled foaming
from my mouth. somewhere in the mess of that morning
she’d become person enough to, in the space between us,
create force of momentum, and then i did not set her down,
but pushed her and she fell away from it against the wall
and was crying because i, her mommy, pushed her. and i know
this should be the poem about how i’m horrified at myself,
the poem about what in ourselves we have to live with,
but in that moment which followed two years of breastfeeding
and baby-wearing and sixty-nine hours of natural childbirth
and the hemorrhaging and the uncertain operation, after which
i pumped every two hours, careful not to let the cord tangle
in the iv. even then when she cried and no matter what
and no matter and no matter and no matter and no matter what,
i held her all night if she cried so she would not ever know
someday you’ll cry alone, but i held her and ached and leaked
and bled too as long as it took. of course there’ve been nights
since but sometimes it feels as if i’ve never been asleep again,
so when i say i pushed my two-year-old against a wall and i don’t
remember it happening that way but it happened and i did
and i’ve been wondering a long time now what the limit is
and when i would find the end of myself, and that day, which
was yesterday, was the end. and this day, when we played
hide-and-seek with daddy, and touched bugs, and read  frog and toad are friends twice together before she read it
to herself as i wrote this, this is the day that comes after.

the woman at the salvation army who sorts and prices is in her eighties
and she underestimates the value of everything, for which i am grateful. lightly used snow suits, size 2t, are $6 and snow boots are $3.there is a little girl, maybe seven, fiddling with a tea set. her mother
inspects drapes for stains. sometimes the very old and lonely are looking for an opening. she glances up from her pricing and says something about the tea set
and a baby doll long ago. i am careful not to make eye contact, but the mother with drapes has
such softness in her shoulders and her face and she knows how to say
the perfect kind thing—“what a wonderful mother you had.” “yes, she was.” why do children sometimes notice us and sometimes not? from the bin of dolls: “what happened to your mother?” “she died.” the woman at the salvation army who sorts and prices is crying a little.
she seems surprised to be crying. “it’s been eighty years and i still miss
her.” when my daughter was born i couldn’t stop thinking about how we
were going to die. if we were drowning, would it be better to hold her
to me even as she fought away or should i let her float off to wonder why
her mother didn’t help her? what if it’s fire and i have one bullet left? i
made sure my husband knew if there were death squads and he had to
choose, i’d never love him again if he didn’t choose her. if i’m lucky,
her crying face is the last thing i’ll see. the mother with drapes is squeezing her daughter’s shoulder, trying to
send a silent message, but children are children. “why did she die?” “she was going to have a baby and—and she died.” “but she was a wonderful mother.” i’m holding a stack of four wooden jigsaw puzzles of farm animals,
dinosaurs, jungle animals, and pets. each for a quarter. “it’s silly how much i still miss her.” she takes out a tissue and wipes
her eyes and then her nose .when my grandmother threw her sister, susie, a 90th birthday party,
one hundred people came, including 5 of the 6 brothers and sisters. at
dusk only a few of us were left, nursing beers with our feet kicked up
on the bottom rungs of various walkers. susie said then to my grandmother, “can you think of all the people
watching us in heaven now? and our mother must be in the front row.” grandma took her sister’s hand. “our mother—estelle.”“yes—her name was estelle. i forgot that.” they looked so happy then, saying her name back and forth to each
other. estelle. estelle.

we were given a curfew on the second day.
clouds filling windows were replaced by soot

we lost the smell of buttered beetroot, wissotzky tea
and kishke; a tendril of root infiltrated a crack
in the floorboards. we kept our distance and let it grow
in disbelief. someone said we should kill it
before it gets too strong. hours, maybe even days,
went by as we hid waiting for attacks and looting
to end. at times, when the door opened, a waft of wind
made its way to those unfolding leaves
waving like the curtains out of blown out windows.

as a kid the only black woman
in my life was my fourth-grade teacher—
i remember her not because she was black
but mostly because of her copper-colored
bob that never changed, as if a piece
of bronze had been chiseled onto her
head and neither i nor my classmates
could prove it was a wig, but we knew it was
too perfect to be real. then you came in-
­to my home—but not the way someone
came in one afternoon while we were away
grocery shopping, leaving the side door wide
open releasing my white-winged parakeet,
my mother’s jewelry and our television,
gone. and for years i watched you go
from analog into digital; you were
the modicum of motherhood i encountered
daily while my mother stood on a production
line mouthing prayers for prosperity
and health in a room of air
compressors. you’re a super galactic
hologram—scattered light reconstructed
through the dark matter, ever-shrinking
pixels—shifting the cosmology
of the world with gigs of gayle, and
revolutionary road trips. and now
will you quietly fade out into the space-
time continuum where not even my imagination
will find you? your last broadcast
like the final song of our beloved parakeet
as it flew past the leafless trees toward
the vast dome of heaven.

for james welchthe first harvest of wheat in flatlands
along the milk startled me into thoughts of you
and this place we both remember and also forget as home.
maybe it was the familiarity or maybe it was my own
need to ask if you have ever regretted leaving.
what bends, what gives?
and have you ever missed this wind?—it has now
grown warm with late summer, but soon
it will be as dangerous as the bobcat stalking calves
and pets just south of the river.
men take out their dogs, a case of beer and wait
in their pickups for dawn, for a chance with their rifles.
they don’t understand that she isn’t going to make
any mistakes. with winter my need for an answer
grows more desperate and there are only four roads out. 
one is the same cat hunters drive with mannish glory
and return along, gun still oil-shined and unshot.
another goes deeper into assiniboine territory:
this is the one i should talk myself into taking next.
i haven’t much traveled the third except to visit
a hospital where, after the first time,
my mother had refused chemotherapy.
and the last road you know as well as i do—
past the coral-painted catholic church, its doors
long ago sealed shut to the mouth of mission canyon,
then south just a ways, to where the rockies cut open 
and forgive. there you and i are on the ascent.
after that, the arrival is what matters most.

some lamp sputters
its dusty light
across some desk.
some hand, shaking,
works the strained
rope, twisting and knifing,
weaving, tugging tight
a bellowing circle. randy
travis, steamy drawl
and hiccup on the staticky
am, backs the ritual
of drooping loop.
sweat drips an awful
hallelujah. god glares
askance, but the artist
doesn’t waver—wrists
click cadence, knots
become a path to what
makes saviors. the sagging
hoop bemoans a need
to squeeze, its craving
for a breath within the ring.

dumbfounded in hospital whites, you are picture-book
itty-bit, floundering in bleach and steel. braids untwirl
and corkscrew, you squirm, the crater in your shoulder
spews a soft voltage. on a tv screwed into the wall
above your head, neon rollicks. a wide-eyed train
engine perfectly smokes, warbles a song about forward. who shot you, baby? i don’t know. i was playing.
you didn’t see anyone? i was playing with my friend sharon. i was on the swing and she was—
are you sure you didn’t—no, i ain’t seen nobody but sharon. i heard people yelling though, and—each bullet repainted you against the brick, kicked
you a little sideways, made you need air differently.
you leaked something that still goldens the boulevard. i ain’t seen nobody, i told you.
and at a. lincoln elementary on washington street,
or jefferson elementary on madison street, or adams
elementary just off the eisenhower expressway,
we gather the ingredients, if not the desire, for pathos: an imploded homeroom, your empty seat pulsating
with drooped celebrity, the sometime counselor
underpaid and elsewhere, a harried teacher struggling
toward your full name. anyway your grades weren’t
all that good. no need to coo or encircle anything,
no call for anyone to pull their official white fingers
through your raveled hair, no reason to introduce
the wild notion of loving you loud and regardless. oh, and they’ve finally located your mama, who
will soon burst in with her cut-rate cure of stammering
jesus’ name. beneath the bandages, your chest crawls
shut. perky ol’ thomas winks a bold-faced lie from
his clacking track, and your heart monitor hums
a wry tune no one will admit they’ve already heard. elsewhere, 23 seconds rumble again and again through
sharon’s body. boom, boom, she says to no one.

when black, men drown. they spend their whole lifetimes
justifying the gall of springing the trap, the inconvenience
of slouched denim, of coupling beyond romance or aim.
all the while, the rising murk edges toward their chins.
hurriedly, someone crafts another scientific tome, a giddy
exploration of the curious dysfunction identifying black
men first as possible, then as necessary. elegant equations
succumb to a river that blurs quotient and theory, rendering
them unreadable, and the overwhelm easily disappears
the men, their wiry heads glistening, then gulped. all that’s
left is the fathers’ last wisdom, soaked wreckage on silver: girl, that water ain’t nothing but wet. i’m gon’ be alright. when black men drown, their daughters turn to their mothers
and ask what should i do with this misnamed shiver in my left shoulder? how should i dress in public? they are weary
of standing at the shore, hands shading their eyes, trying
to make out their own fathers among the thousands bobbing
in the current. the mothers mumble and point to any flailing
that seems familiar. mostly, they’re wrong. buoyed by church
moans and comfort food of meat and cream, the daughters
try on other names that sound oddly broken when pressed
against the dank syllables of the fathers’. drained, with just forward in mind, they walk using the hip of only one parent.
they scratch in their sleep. black water wells up in the wound. when black men drown, their daughters are fascinated with
the politics of water, how gorgeously a surface breaks
to receive, how it weeps so sanely shut. and the thrashing
of hands, shrieking of names: i was otis, i was willie earl, they called me catfish. obsessed by the waltzing of tides,
the daughters remember their fathers—the scorch of beard
electrifying the once-in-a-while kiss, the welts in thick arms,
eyes wearied with so many of the same days wedged behind
them. when black men drown, their daughters memorize all
the steps involved in the deluge. they know how long it takes
for a weakened man to dissolve. a muted light, in the shape
of a little girl, used to be enough to light a daddy’s way home. when black men drown, their daughters drag the water’s floor
with rotting nets, pull in whatever still breathes. they insist their
still-dripping daddies sit down for cups of insanely sweetened
tea, sniffs of rotgut, tangled dinners based on improbable swine.
the girls hope to reacquaint their drowned fathers with the concept
of body, but outlines slosh in drift and retreat. the men can’t get
dry. parched, they scrub flooded hollows and weep for water
to give them name and measure as mere blood once did. knocking
over those spindly-legged dinette chairs, they interrupt the failed
feast and mutter baby girl, gotta go, baby gotta go, their eyes
misted with their own murders. grabbing their girls, they spit
out love in reverse and stumble toward the banks of some river. when black men drown their daughters, the rash act is the only
plausible response to the brain’s tenacious mouth and its dare: yes, yes, open your ashed hands and release that wingless child. note
the arc of the sun-drenched nosedive, the first syllable of the child’s
name unwilling from the man’s mouth, the melody of billow that
begins as blessed clutch. someone crouching inside the father waits
impatiently for the shutting, the lethargic envelop, and wonders if
the daughter’s wide and realizing eye will ever close to loose him.
it never will, and the man and his child and the daughter and her
father gaze calmly into the wrecked science of each other’s lives.
the sun struggles to spit a perfect gold upon the quieting splash.
the river pulses stylish circles of its filth around the swallow.

it seems insane now, but
she’d be standing soaked
in schoolday morning light,
her loose-leaf notebook,
flickering at the bus stop,
and we almost trembled at the thought of her mouth
filled for a moment with both
of our short names. i don’t know
what we saw when we saw
her face, but at fifteen there’s
so much left to believe in, that a girl with sunset
in her eyes, with a kind smile,
and a bright blue miniskirt softly
shading her bare thighs
really
could be the goddess. even
the gloss on her lips sighed kiss me
and you’ll never
do homework again. some saturdays
my ace, terry, would say, “guess
who was buying teaberry gum
in the drugstore on stenton?”
and i could see the sweet
epiphany still stunning his eyes and i knew that he knew
that i knew he knew
i knew—
especially once summer had come,
and the sun stayed up till we had
nothing else to do but wish
and wonder about fine sistasin flimsy culottes and those hotpants! 
james brown screamed about: crystal
berry, diane ramsey, kim graves,
and her. this was around 1970: vietnam
to the left of us, black muslims
to the right, big afros all over my philadelphia. we had no idea
where we were, how much history
had come before us—how much
cruelty, how much more dying
was on the way. for me and terry,
it was a time when everything said
maybe, and maybe being blinded
by the beauty of a tenth grader
was proof that, for a little while,
we were safe from the teeth
that keep chewing up the world.
i’d like to commendmy parents
for keeping calm,
for not quitting their jobs or grabbing
guns
and for never letting up
about the amazing “so many doors
open to good students.” i wish i had kissed
delores jepps. i wish i could
have some small memory of her
warm and spicy mouth to wrap
these hungry words around. I would like to have danced with her,
to have slow-cooked to a slow song
in her sleek, toffee arms: her body
balanced between the temptations’ 
five voices and me—a boy anointed with puberty, a kid with a b
average and a cool best friend.
i don’t think i’ve ever understood
how lonely i am, but i was closer to it at fifteen because
i didn’t know anything: my heart
so near the surface of my skini could have moved it with my hand.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
it’s true: i almost never
smile, but that doesn’t mean i’m not
in love: my heart
is that black violin
played slowly. you know that moment late in the solo
when the voice
is so pure
you feel
the blood in it: the wound between rage
and complete surrender. that’s
where i’m smiling. you just
can’t see it—the sound bleeding perfectly
inside me. the first time
i killed a vampire
i was sad: i mean
we were almost
family. but that’s
so many lives
ago. i believe in the cry that cuts
into the melody, the strings
calling back the forgotten world. when i think of the madness
that has made me
and the midnight
i walk inside—all day long: when i think of that
one note
that breaks
what’s left of what’s
human in me, man, i love
everything
<|endoftext|>

i remember that first time:
the empty auditorium, her voice,
the dark all around us,
her mouth reaching into mine.
she was freddy’s foxy older sister,
and i didn’t know why
she wanted to kiss me. she
had already finished high school
and probably shouldn’t have
been walking the halls, but
she always called me her friend.
so one monday after gym,i found myself beside myself
in front of her house—with my
trench coat and lunch bag—
probably not looking much
like shaft. inside, the air held
warm milk and we talked a bit
about her baby
and her aunt
who paid the rent painting cars. maybe she liked me because
we were both black and mostly
alone in the suburbs, but i hadn’t
thought about that. it was her voice
that got me—banked fire, the color
of dusk—her voice, and my name
was smoke in her mouth. i think about it more than i should now,
that january noon—an hour before
algebra—how most days i’d be
thinking football
or replaying
the seventy-some kisses i’d gotten
over those lean years, but that day donna and me were on the couch
munching potato chips. rrruffles have rrridges, she kidded coming
from checking the baby who’d
slipped into a nap. i was kind of
disappointed that we hadn’t
done anything, but i needed time
to get back to school, so i started
to stand. she said wait, look at this mess ,and with her left hand, she
brushed the crumbs from my lap
the way you’d whisk away lint—
then, swept over my pants again—
to be thorough, i guessed, but slower
and then some more, as if her hand were getting
drowsy. you know
how sometimes you see something
but just can’t believe it—like a squirrel
bobbling a biscuit on your kitchen counter
or a cricket creeping the red feathers
of your mother’s sunday hat? her hand there, on my lap,
could easily have been a five-fingered
flying saucer from the fifth dimension.
for awhile, i just watched and
wondered if she knew where
her hand had landed
but it was me
who didn’t know: me with my
six dozen kisses and the great eden
of my virginity. how
do we not talk about it every day: the ways
we were changed
by the gift
in someone’s touch—your body,
suddenly a bright instrument
played by an otherwise
silent divinity. when i heard my zipper, i couldn’t
have said where my arms
were
or what a clock was for:
i had
no idea
i could be such a stranger
and still be myself. how could i
have known what a girl might do to a boy
with her mouth
if she felt
like doing what her mouth
could do? it was
a kind of miracle: the dreamed impossible—my soul finally called
to my flesh. i didn’t know
what i didn’t know
and then i knew.

i used to think
that if i loved hard
enough and long enough
passion would always win out like the way i loved
cologne, venturing teenaged into
congested malls, abusing testers
only a salesperson surly enough inquiring if he or she could help
me in any way, spitting
the prices of even the smallest
bottles of the scents i had slathered on, forcing me out
in a cloud of confidence
that i was the calvin klein
man, not the old spiceman, not the zest
man, and certainly not
the my drafty house is warmed badly
by kerosene heaters man impervious to my real
life where i would sneak
down in the middle
of the night, passing snow collecting
on the inside of the window
sill, trying to descend
the stairs silently to complete the night lying
before the stove’s vents blowing
sooty warm air deep into my
sleeping lungs, clutching a broken lacrosse stick
to intimidate rats so brazen
our housecats accepted
them as equal occupants until i exit those automatic
doors, leave fountains where
just out of range i envy white
families tossing entire cigarette packs’ worth
of what they call spare
change, wishing for things
they could already buy if they wanted laughing as those presidential
faces fall sometimes up
and sometimes down, all drowning
in three inches of chlorinated well water return to the reservation
where my sister-
in-law embraces me later
the same day, drawing deeply, saying she loves
the scent of burned heating
oil on men, that it reminds
her of when she and my brother dated and she would hold
him long in those last moments
before allowing him to walk out
her door, meander through snowy grooves, finding his way home
while she looked out windows
where ice crystals gathered
on the proper side of the pane holding her breath as long as she
dared, letting his presence seep
out only when she could no longer
bear, leaving him to be a vapor ghost on her window, a fog sure
to vanish even before she turned
from the window and here i am
years later living in that same state, you miles away and i,
knowing how presence disperses
into air, wonder how long
i can hold my breath.

the unsympathetic wind, how she has evaded me for years now,
leaving a guileless shell and no way to navigate. once when i stood
on a plateau of earth just at the moment before the dangerous,
jutting peaks converged upon the lilting sway of grasslands, i almost
found a way back. there, the sky, quite possibly all the elements,
caused the rock and soil and vegetation to congregate. their prayer
was not new and so faint i could hardly discern. simple remembrances,
like a tiny, syncopated chorus calling everyone home: across
a thousand eastward miles, and what little wind was left at my back.
but i could not move. and then the music was gone.
all that was left were the spring time faces of mountains, gazing down,
their last patches of snow, luminous. i dreamed of becoming snow melt,
gliding down the slope and in to the valley. with the promise,
an assurance, that there is always a way to become bird, tree, water again.

some lunatic with a gun killed some people at an
immigration center in binghamton, new york. liz
rosenberg and her family live up there and david, her
husband, teaches in the middle school which is close to
all the action (the way, in any smallish town, everything is
close to all the action). i called liz to see if everyone was
all right and she was in her car driving to the elementary
school to pick up lily, her young daughter she brought
back from china a few years ago. lily was fine, but
liz wanted to move her outside the question of how to
make sense of the broken pieces of “someone” with a
gun walking into a public space and then firing. there’s
something called (i learned from a news report the day of
the shootings at virginia tech) the talking day which
refers to the day immediately following the day when
something wildly violent happens. no one quite grasps
the reality of the situation and everyone spends that first day
talking about what happened and reliving it as language—
not so much to understand the violence but to make a
kind of recording of it: talking about it, letting go of it,
putting it down. and so i imagine it must be with liz and
lily and david in binghamton, new york today: letting
“something” go. liz is in her car after having just picked up
lily at school and driving back home through a town that
suddenly makes no sense and she is telling the story about
what happened when a young man walked into a building
with a gun. and for lily, who’s had a pretty serene, un-
violent united states time so far and whose endless joy
has made her an adorable chatterbox, tomorrow could be
her first talking day. or, if not tomorrow, some other day.
we live in a talking day world.

the radio clicks on—it’s poor swollen america,
up already and busy selling the exhausting obligation
of happiness while intermittently debating whether or not
a man who kills fifty people in five minutes
with an automatic weapon he has bought for the purpose
is mentally ill. or a terrorist. or if terrorists
are mentally ill. because if killing large numbers of people
with sophisticated weapons is a sign of sickness—
you might want to begin with fire, our early ancestors
drawn to the warmth of it—from lightning,
must have been, the great booming flashes of it
from the sky, the tree shriveled and sizzling,
must have been, an awful power, the odor
of ozone a god’s breath; or grass fires,
the wind whipping them, the animals stampeding,
furious, driving hard on their haunches from the terror
of it, so that to fashion some campfire of burning wood,
old logs, must have felt like feeding on the crumbs
of the god’s power and they would tell the story
of prometheus the thief, and the eagle that feasted
on his liver, told it around a campfire, must have been,
and then—centuries, millennia—some tribe
of meticulous gatherers, some medicine woman,
or craftsman of metal discovered some sands that,
tossed into the fire, burned blue or flared green,
so simple the children could do it, must have been,
or some soft stone rubbed to a powder that tossed
into the fire gave off a white phosphorescent glow.
the word for chemistry from a greek—some say arabic—
stem associated with metal work. but it was in china
two thousand years ago that fireworks were invented—
fire and mineral in a confined space to produce power—

and the power of steam: 100 bc, julius caesar’s day.
in alexandria, a greek mathematician produced
a steam-powered turbine engine. contain, explode.

alan drives a cab at night,
has cab driver’s elbow
in his left arm,
sells real estate by day. alan dreams of a big deal,
of opening a classy poolhall.
has a four million dollar deal
which will probably fall through,
has a big land deal with the post office
but it will take 20 years to deliver
because they are so slow. alan collects baseball cards and comic books
hates condos and townhouses
though he lives in one.
was a trader for nineteen and one-half years
then fired when the market melted. alan, even if he was rich,
would not let his stepdaughter
by his second wife
have her own phone and private line
like her rich friend rebecca has
because after all she is only twelve. alan, half jewish, has three tattoos.
“i got them recently because i wanted them.
my jewish aunt nearly had a stroke
when she saw them.”alan admits he is a pack rat saving
everything, loves wood, restoration, and antiques.
alan admires the people who buy old houses
and fix them up.
hates the development of staten island
blaming it on the people from brooklyn. alan was cooking sausages and onions
(his other half is italian)
in his back yard
when a woman knocked his parked car
into the next block,
totaled it; he got $1,200 more
than it was worth. alan found a turtle and put
it in a safe stream,
stopped a dog from killing a cock
in historic richmondtown. alan hates the dump—
ninety-four percent of the garbage there
is dropped by the other boroughs—
likes the idea of secession,
staten island free and independent. alan apologetically asks
if he didn’t talk too much
as he brings me to my destination. he leaves me a great silence
and i wish i had one million american bucks
to tip the exuberant alan. alan, take this million bucks
strip the paint off the good wood of your dreams
and tattoo the tedious days.

nettles, smear bearberry juice in the gashes. crack open the jail-seed. second:
tear away the bars which restrain

the age of portrait is drugged. beauty
is symmetry so rare it’s a mystery.
my left eye is smaller than my right,
my big mouth shows my nice teeth perfectly
aligned like muslims in prayer.
my lips an accordion. each sneeze
a facial thumbprint. one corner
of my mouth hangs downward when i want
to hold a guffaw hostage. bell’s palsy perhaps
or what mark twain said about steamboat piloting,
that a doctor’s unable to look upon the blush
in a young beauty’s face without thinking
it could be a fever, a malar rash,
a butterfly announcing a wolf. can i lie
facedown now as cadavers posed
on first anatomy lesson? i didn’t know mine
was a woman until three weeks later
we turned her over. out of reverence
there was to be no untimely exposure of donors,
our patrons who were covered in patches
of scrubs-green dish towels,
and by semester’s end we were sick of all that,
tossed mega livers and mammoth hearts
into lab air and caught them. my body
was margaret. that’s what the death certificate said
when it was released before finals. the cause
of her death? nothing memorable,
frail old age. but the colonel on table nineteen
with an accessory spleen had put a bullet through
his temple, a final prayer. not in entry or exit
were there skull cracks to condemn the house
of death, no shattered glass in the brain,
only a smooth tunnel of deep violet that bloomed
in concentric circles. the weekends were lonely.
he had the most beautiful muscles
of all 32 bodies that were neatly arranged,
zipped up as if a mass grave had been disinterred.
or when unzipped and facing the ceiling
had cloth over their eyes as if they’d just been executed.
gray silver hair, chiseled countenance,
he was sixty-seven, a veteran of more than one war.
i had come across that which will end me, ex­-
tend me, at least once, without knowing it.

the sudden pink shape
surfacing in black-water lagoons
shocked explorers.
all dolphins share man’s
thumb and fingerbones,
but these also wear his flesh.
when the river overflows
and floods the varzea, 
these dolphins travel miles
to splash in the shallows
amongst buttress-roots of giant
rainforest trees.
the waters abate, trapping fish,
dolphins never. a lamp burning dolphin oil
blinds. at night
the pink-flesh contours melt and blur.
the flipper extends the hidden hand
to lift its woman’s torso
to the land. an eve,
born each night from the black amazon,
roams the dark banks for victims
to draw to the water and death.
taboo to the indians,
this pink daughter of the river’s magic
always looks, to explorers,
like she’s smiling.

a mother possum crawled down the chimney
the spring donny came to us
because both sets of his parents had kicked him out,
the same april after your dad and i divorced
when you kicked a hole in the dining room wall.
the possum was swollen with young
she would later carry, half-grown, on her back
or hanging from her thick, hairless tail.
“an oversized rat with maternal instincts,”
your dad once said. instead of one angry son, i now had two–
fifteen and seventeen–
two forged signatures on absence excuses,
two discipline committee meetings,
two conferences with the principal.
while i worked,
you shared contraband beer,
as well as the basement bedroom
with its fieldstone fireplace
in which you found the possum one cool evening. laughing and cheering, you teamed up
to cage her with a trash can,
carry her to the alley out back and dump her.
the possum squeezed back
down the chimney twice more. the third time
you threw her out on troost avenue, screaming
for a car to smash her beneath its tires.
she must have been near her time,
desperate for a nest,
to crawl back down after that.
the noise woke me after midnight.
donny had clubbed her with his nunchuks.
you both kicked and stomped
her head as she lurched, stumbled
between your feet.
halfway down
the basement steps i stopped,
seeing your faces. the possum fell
limp. i backed slowly up the stairs.in the morning, you couldn’t meet my eyes.
i just made you clean up the mess.

his eyelids like a moth’s fringed wings.
arms flail against the ninja turtle sheet
and suddenly-long legs
race time. awake, he’s a water-leak detector, a recycling ranger
who bans styrofoam and asks for beeswax
crayons, a renewable resource.
he wants to adopt the missouri river,
write the president
to make factories stop polluting. they’re old friends, he and george bush.
he writes and scolds
the president, every month or so,
about the bombing the children of iraq
(he made his own sign to carry in protest),
about the plight of the california condor and northern gray wolf,
about more shelters and aid for the homeless.
the lion-shaped bulletin board in his room
is covered with pictures and letters from george,
who must be nice,
even if he is a slow learner. joseph is a mystery fan, owns 54 nancy drews.
nancy’s his friend, along with jo, meg, and amy
and poor beth, of course, whom he still mourns.
he also reads of knights and wizards, superheroes,
and how to win at nintendo. the cats and houseplants are his to feed and water
and the sunflower blooming in the driveway’s border
of weeds. he drew our backyard to scale,
using map symbols, sent off to have it declared
an official wildlife refuge, left a good-night

the fallout from the battles
in the streets. days, we’re
the peaceful, devoted
pair all our friends envy.
nights are always tense
around the dmz that is our bed
with occasional forays into the bush
where the enemy is always lying
in wait. sleep is hard, fearful
and troubled. i dream us
going down in flames.

watts bleeds
leaving stained reminders
on dusty sidewalks. here where i strut alone
as glass lies broken by my feet
and a blanket of darkness is slung
across the wooden shacks
of nuetsra colonia. watts bleeds
dripping from carcasses of dreams:
where despair
is old people
sitting on torn patio sofas
with empty eyes
and children running down alleys
with big sticks. watts bleeds
on vacant lots
and burned-out buildings–
temples desolated by a people’s rage. where fear is a deep river.
where hate is an overgrown weed. watts bleeds
even as we laugh,
recall good times,
drink and welcome daylight
through the broken windshield
of an old impala. here is the watts of my youth,
where teachers threw me
from classroom to classroom,
not knowing where i could fit in. where i learned to fight or run,
where i zigzagged down alleys,
jumped over fences,
and raced by graffiti on crumbling
factory walls. where we played
between boxcars,
bleeding from
broken limbs and torn flesh,
and where years later
we shot up carga 
in the playground
of our childhood. watts bleeds
as the shadow of the damned
engulfs all the chinga of our lives. in the warmth of a summer night,
gunshots echo their deadly song
through the silence of fear;
prelude to a heartbeat. watts bleeds
as i bled
getting laid-off from work,
standing by my baby’s crib,
touching his soft check
and fingering his small hand
as dreams shatter again,
dreams of fathers
for little men. watts bleeds
and the city hemorrhages,
unable to stop the flow
from this swollen and festering sore. oh bloom, you trampled flower!
come alive as once
you tried to do from the ashes. watts, bleeding and angry,
you will be free.

all night vigil.
my two-and-a-half-year-old boy
and his 10-month-old sister
lay on the same bed,
facing opposite ends;
their feet touching.
they looked soft, peaceful,
bundled there in strands of blankets.
i brushed away roaches that meandered
across their faces,
but not even that could wake them.
outside, the dark cover of night tore
as daybreak bloomed like a rose
on a stem of thorns.
i sat down on the backsteps,
gazing across the yellowed yard.
a 1954 chevy bel-air stared back.
it was my favorite possession.
i hated it just then.
it didn’t start when i tried to get it going
earlier that night. it had a bad solenoid.
i held a 12-gauge shotgun across my lap.
i expected trouble from the paragons gang
of the west lynwood barrio.
somebody said i dove the car
that dudes from colonia watts used
to shoot up the paragons’ neighborhood.
but i got more than trouble that night.
my wife had left around 10 p.m.
to take a friend of mine home.
she didn’t come back.
i wanted to kill somebody.
at moments, it had nothing to do
with the paragons.
it had to do with a woman i loved.
but who to kill? not her–
sweet allure wrapped in a black skirt.
i’d kill myself first.
kill me first?
but she was the one who quit!
kill her? no, think man! i was hurt, angry. . .
but to kill her? to kill a paragon?
to kill anybody?
i went into the house
and put the gun away. later that morning, my wife came for her things:
some clothes, the babies. . . their toys.
a radio, broken tv, and some dishes remained.
i didn’t stop her.
there was nothing to say that my face
didn’t explain already.
nothing to do. . . but run.so i drove the long haul to downey
and parked near an enclosed area
alongside the los angeles river.
i got out of the car,
climbed over the fence
and stumbled down the slopes.
a small line of water rippled in the middle.
on rainy days this place flooded and flowed,
but most of the time it was dry
with dumped garbage and dismembered furniture.
since a child, the river and its veins of canals
were places for me to think. places to heal.
once on the river’s bed, i began to cleanse.
i ran. i ran into the mist of morning,
carrying the heat of emotion
through the sun’s rays;
i ran past the factories
that lay smack in the middle
of somebody’s backyard.
i ran past alleys with overturned trashcans
and mounds of tires.
debris lay underfoot. overgrown weeds
scraped my legs as i streamed past;
recalling the song of bullets
that whirred in the wind. i ran across bridges, beneath overhead passes,
and then back alongside the infested walls
of the concrete river;
splashing rainwater as i threaded,
my heels colliding against the pavement.
so much energy propelled my legs
and, just like the river,
it went on for miles. when all was gone,
the concrete river
was always there
and me, always running.

when heavy tells a story
the millwright shanty under the electric furnaces
chokes with quiet, amid the roar,
as heavy pauses, adjusts his mountainous weight
over a creaky grease-stained metal chair
and looks up at the whirling ceiling fan
next to fluorescent lights hanging by wires.
his fingers lace like so many sausages
across the canvas of blue workshirt
on his chest. heavy tells his story
and the voice of reason quickens the demise
of foulness from red-faced millwrights
just back from a repair job
and sitting around for the five air whistles
that again call them to combat on the furnace floor. all laughter stops, all nonsense sayings
and cuts of wisdom cease their echo
when heavy tells a story. heavy talks about the mexican melter
who once had an affair with the pit boss’s wife.
the heart of the problem–and the fact
from which the story’s plot revolves–
was that the melter lived across the street
from the pit boss.
one night just before the graveyard shift,
the melter left his home, kissed his wife’s
round face and proceeded to walk to the bus stop.
but a bullet pierced through his hardhat
and he fell, like an overturned stack of fire bricks,
onto the pavement.
the moral of this story:
never have an affair with someone
whose old man lives
within shooting distance. heavy tells a story
about a furnace foreman who always yelled
at the laborers for failing to clean
the bag house of the built-up filth
from hours of cooking scrap iron and ore.
the men told him it was too dangerous
to walk on the tin-roofed panels;
their weight could cause
them to fall some 30 feet
into the gaping mouth of a flaming furnace below.
“nonsense,” the foreman yelled,
“you’re all just lazy polacks.”
(he called everyone polacks).
the foreman then proceeded to walk
across the roof as the men stood nearby,
with mouths open, near the safety of side beams.
“you see,” he said standing in the middle
as hydraulics moved shutters
up and down to capture the sulphur dust. then the foreman moved forward
and before anyone could shout,
he crashed through the roof,
screaming into a reddened pot of molten metal;
the oxygen in his body making popping sounds
as it entered. the furnace operates continued
to pour ladles of scrap iron and to melt the steel.
they skimmed the slag off the top
and when it was ready, they poured
the molten mass into ingot molds.
there was nothing they could do for the foreman,
they said. production had to keep going. heavy looks into the eyes of his listeners and says:
somewhere there’s a skyscraper in downtown la
with steel beams made from the ingot
with the foreman’s body in it.
somewhere there’s a bridge or underground pipe
with the man’s remains chemically bound
within the molecular structure. heavy tells a story. . .and the men lay down their tools,
and coffee is poured into heavy ceramic cups,
the shanty stills beneath the rumbling,
and even foremen stop by
to pay a listen
when heavy tells a story.

continue to pour my thoughts out on this topic of discussion
slow down, i keep gettin the feeling that i’m rushin
like my cousin’s dying breaths, or the decision that was made
but lemme backtrack, letting feelings get in the way
a normal adolescent, aspiring for the highest
goals that were attainable, wanted to be the flyest
we all searchin for something we’ve made a pact to do
the drive of ambition, it’s in us, it’s in you
now snatch every dream that a mother had for her son
and replace that with a breath, “baby, just take another one!”
a white man’s gun, the very courier of evil
he left, enjoyed his night, but the gunshots were lethal
deceitful, everything we’ve been told from the start
we’ve more than just some ghetto thugs, these thoughts split us
apart
what you must understand is our culture bore from oppression
the hip hop inside of us a form of expression
i wish i had the chance to explain to jordan’s killer
that the song “beef” by lil reese shouldn’t label him a dealer
or is he ignorant or another ghetto thug?
do you understand that your ignorance filled him with 3 slugs?
i don’t want sympathy and i don’t want affection
i want this country to head in the right direction
instead of discussin who the grammys should be awardin
work to prevent murders like those of my cousin, jordan.

this is to say we continued. as though continuing changed us.
as though continuing brought happiness as we had known. on a dry field without cover, his skin blistered raw in the sun.
not one among us came, as though he had no relations. what did we say to our brother? how could we leave him alone
while soldiers guarded his corpse as though precious to them? one of the women, in darkness, crept to the field where he died,
prayed for him, covered him up. dust over what was not dust. we would have ventured out with her if we had loved ourselves less.
we had to think of our children, and he was not coming back. how could we live with the silence, live with our grief and our shame?
death did not heal what he suffered. he was making demands. we did not want him to be there, asking the question he asked us,
changing the sound of his name. he had embarrassed us. this is the memory we carried, avoiding the thought that he remained
face down among the charred grasses, holding the earth with his hands.

the first question is always phrased this way:
“so. how much indian are you?”
we did not live in tepees.
we did not braid our hair.
we did not fringe our shirts.
we did not wear war bonnets.
we did not chase the buffalo.
we did not carry shields.
we were never plains indians.
we tried to ride,
but we kept falling off of our dogs.
a local official came to our office to ask our help with a city event. he had a splendid idea, he said. to kick off the event and show everyone in town that our tribe was still around, we should go up to the bluff overlooking the city and make a big smoke signal. then they would know we were here.
who ever heard of smoke signals in the forests? i imagined us upon the bluff, lighting one of those firestarter bricks. we haven’t made fire since the boy scouts took over. and how would the citizens know it was us? they’d probably call the fire department.
as they ask, they think, yes,
i can see it in her face. high cheekbones
(whatever those are) and dark hair. here’s a thought: don’t we all have
high cheekbones? if we didn’t,
our faces would cave in.
(but i do have a colonized nose.) i’m sick of explaining myself. “you know,” i finally say,
“it doesn’t matter to my people.”

when i learned i might have cancer,
i bought fifteen white lilies. easter was gone:
the trumpets were wilted, plants crooked with roots
bound in pots. i dug them into the garden,
knowing they would not bloom for another year.
all summer, the stalks stood like ramshackle posts
while i waited for results. by autumn, the stalks
had flopped down. more biopsies, laser incisions,
the cancer in my tongue a sprawling mass. outside,
the earth remained bare, rhizomes shrunken
below the frost line. spring shoots appeared
in bright green skins, and lilies bloomed
in july, their waxed trumpets pure white,
dusting gold pollen to the ground.
this year,
tripled in number, they are popping up again. i wait,
a ceremony, for the lilies to open, for the serpentine length
of the garden to bloom in the shape of my tongue’s scar,
a white path with one end leading into brilliant air,
the other down the throat’s canyon, black
and unforgiving. i try to imagine
what could grow in such darkness. i am waiting
for the lilies to open.

did she ruin the belt, scrape her nose
did they drink a lot of beer afterwards? and so the time drags by, the line lengthens
now and then people unbury their heads
from their midmorning dragging into noon thoughts
women adjust their bra straps
scold their kids with unfulfilled warnings
the folks behind the counter look at us
holding their half empty cups of coffee ah, if only there was a dollar for every story

throughout the years i have designed
high-end custom homes
crafting spatial poetics with vigas and latillas 
hand peeled by mojados 
whose sweat translates into profit for developers
working at a nifty rate sometimes i go visit these homes
as they are being finished
may i help you? 
i am asked by the realtor
standing at the door,
thinking that i may be the guy
who mixed the mud and pushed the wheelbarrow i introduce myself as the designer
oh, well, it’s so nice to meet you, what a wonderful job! please, come in. i was once asked by a home magazine journalist
if i felt insulted by such incidents well, no, i said, my mind mixing for an answer a good batch of cement is never accidental 
last year on my way up through santa fe
i made a detour and drove by a house of my design
the season’s first snow on the ground,
smoke rising out of the fireplace chimney inch by inch
i know that house
through its x, y, and z axis but, i cannot approach the front door
knock and expect to be invited in
to sit in the corner of my pleasing
and lounge around with the owner
as we sip on cups of hot herbal tea
making small talk about the weather
or discussing a reading
by the latest author come through
as the sun’s last light
streams in gallantly
through the window
just where i placed it
and for that reason i take a handful of snow to my mouth
toss another into the air
my blessings upon the inhabitants que dios los bendiga y les dé más 
my grandfather would have said i turn my car toward home
to my mother’s house
a place near and far to me
she, my mother, is bedridden
and my brother is the self-appointed caretaker
to bathe and feed her
bring her morsels of conversation it is their own world now ruled by a juxtaposition of understanding
against what i have come to know, now
here, so far and away
i am greeted at her front yard
by an old, propped up trunk hood
proclaiming my brother’s spray-painted inscription
jesus saves 
on the opposite side it reads
keep out! 
i guess it just depends on what kind of day he’s having, 
someone once remarked
like a rattlesnake
it’s a fair warning years ago i accepted this madness
and called it not my own it’s better that he be drunk on christ, said my mother than on what he used to drink we all agreed

now begins the festival and rivalry of late fall,
the weird debauch and daring debacle
of frat-boy parties as students parade foggy streets in mock
processions, bearing on shoulders scrawny effigies of dead,
defeated indians cut from trees, where,
in the twilight, they had earlier been hung. "just dummies," laughs our dad, "red indians hung
or burned—it's only in jest." every fall
brings the big game against stanford, where
young scholars let off steam before the debacle
they may face of failed exams. "you're dead
wrong," he says to mom. "they don't mock real, live indians." around uc campus, mock
lynchings go on. beneath porches we see hung
the scarecrow natives with fake long braids, dead
from the merrymaking. on bancroft way, one has fallen
indecorously to a lawn, a symbol of the debacle
that happened three generations ago in california's hills, where native peoples were strung up. (a way of having fun? where
did they go, those indian ghosts?) "their kids perform mock
war dances, whooping, re-enacting scenes of a debacle
white folks let loose," chides mom. "meanwhile we hang
portraits of presidents on school walls and never let fall
the old red, white, and blue. my dear brother is dead because he fought in a white man's war. how many dead
indians do they need to feel okay? this whole thing wears
on my soul." in the dark car we go silent, and the fall
night gets chillier. in yards, blazing bonfires mock
the stars that glow palely somewhere above. a thin moon hangs
over the tule fogs. i've never heard the word "debacle” before and wonder what it means. "what's a debacle,
mom? " i ask. "oh, honey, it's a terrible and deadly
collapse. complete ruin." i've noticed how the hung
indians have their heads slumped forward. they wear
old clothes, headbands with feathers, face paint, moc-
casins instead of boots. little do we know, this fall, living indians at feather falls
leave tobacco to mark that, indeed,
we're still here, lungs full of indigenous air.

we could hear her
knocking down strands of cobweb
from ceilings—sticky filaments,
sacs of eggs—as we woke most mornings
to a worm of discontent.
it lodged beneath the heart,
rubbed our frayed nerves,
gnawed at the gut, spleen,
ovaries. filth was mom's first enemy, so each day
began with ritual cleaning: the stab
and sweep of the broom down the dark hall,
over the stained and scratched oak floors. for weeks, she held her dust mop
one-handed, and with the other
cupped a hernia, while she swore
at us kids in that hard voice—a litany of our sins
and failures: sloth,
stupidity, secrecy. we watched her
smash the spiders that ran, herky-jerky,
along the baseboards, while we ran, too. glaring at each other,
we gathered up the scattered
laundry, our father’s shoes,
his newspapers and tools, our books,
drawings, music, sweatshirts,
and jackets, whatever
we’d left lying around. we were guilty, but good
at evasion. we cultivated
shrewish or obsessive behaviors of our own: my tough
older sister sneered and stalked out of the house
to meet her boyfriend;
my sweet younger sister
trembled and cried, comforted
by one of our many dogs.
i slammed doors, pounded them
with my fists, screamed, “shut up,
shut up, shut up!” she couldn’ tleave us alone. she loved us
too much. though we were quick, she was
quicker. her words stung. we must have deserved it.

desert heat, high clouds, and sky
the color of lapis. on this journey,
anything seems possible,
so we stop by an ancient cottonwood
to kiss. the beauty trembles,
doesn't say a word, just watches
me, so open. small birds fly by, flock
in the shady tree above us. what
settles in her heart? what congeals?
hope? despair? far off, the river churns
in its sandy banks, swallows veer, turn
in fiery air. will these kisses seal
her to me? i her lover, she my wife?
is all of this a dream, my whole life?2
she is just this side of wonderful,
and suddenly the glamorous world
fills itself with shining and we laugh
at highway monuments that explain
how hard the trek had been for franciscans
in the indian wilderness, poor fellows—
conversion is the devil's own
work! then the stones of her dream
turn up under her feet, the back
of a huge land turtle. i know
we must be circling paradise
because the ants enter the fleshy petals
of the roadside flowers with evident
joy and purpose (oh, my dark, pretty one).3
music, my adored. when is there never
music? my accordion puffs up
with drinkable melodies. i spill
her tunes into your listening ear,
one after the other: the squeeze-box
enters the dance of the plaintive gypsy
with its hard rhythms, lilts the back-
breaking labor song the worker croons
to earth, warbles romantic notes of
dissolving borders. you melt
like a woman beneath her lover's touch.
music is happy and pitiless when
it sets fire to combustible souls. even
the raspy bandoneon's voice is lyric.4
sacred. sacred. sacred. sacred. (speak
in a whisper.) we slip into this
space half cognizant. the land is very
large indeed: bones of the earth
worn down, though she is a living thing.
see how she exposes her grace? antelopes
graze on the far plain—their high,
white tails—the red soil throbs
its slow heartbeat, and the blue sky
clears so smartly, perfectly, like
radiance. are the ancestors near?
what can we know? we decide
to wander around this prairie, mistaken
for utes, buy commodities in little towns.5
late afternoon we head west along the willow-banked
malheur after the long curve of the snake river plain.
(above the falls where the shoshone went to pray
we soaked our feet in cold water, and i observed
the arch of her brown foot.) rabbitbrush and sage
along the highway, juniper on far hills and bluffs.
sundown, and dusk falls over the wide basin of land.
in burns we eat eggs in a cafe, take a room
in the motel 6. in the dark, i can see
her black hair, black against the pillows. its clean
scent makes me think of corn. at dawn, i hold her
and there are kisses. then more kisses. then more.
the day is cold; a north wind blew last night. but
the land is open. rain falls in showers of light.6
her hand on my thigh, my shoulder,
in my hair. she leans over to kiss my cheek.
we look at each other, smile. for miles
we travel this way, nearly silent, point
with eyes or chins at the circling hawk, the king-
fisher on the snag above the swollen
creek. one night i weep in her arms
as she cries, "oh, oh, oh!" because i have touched
her scars lightly: throat, belly, breasts.
in that communion of lovers, thick sobs
break from me as i think of my love
back home, all that i have done
and cannot say. this is the first time
i have left her so completely, so alone.

ours was a play-filled childhood; irrigation ditches ran deep
during the summers. we played in the water and dirt, then inscribed
abcs and numbers onto the smooth ground. our cat polly died
of rabies; then all the pets had to be shot, some in the rib cage
as they thrashed in panic. there was a pink bruise
on my forehead from pressing against the wall. we couldn't figure out how such a thing could happen. the dogs were steadfast figures
around the farm. they chased strange cars and sometimes invoked deep
panic among visitors and passers by. they had cuts and bruises
from scuffles with roaming packs. no tags were inscribed
with their random navajo names. snazzy was skinny; his rib cage
obvious through thin fur. he looked as if he might die from hunger, but he ate like nobody's business. who knew he would die
of rabies with the rest? the main thing was to figure
out how they contracted it, my parents said. we cried until our rib cages
ached; our eyes stayed swollen. this first loss was too deep
to even talk about. decades later, i can finally describe
how that summer led us into a grief that felt like a bruise that would last forever. but our neighbor suffered worse bruises:
their huge dog, named dog, was the first to die
and was the cause of all this. their home and fields are inscribed
in our memories as "the rabies place." over time, they must have figured
it was too much to live down. childhood losses run deep,
even though we are grandparents now. the memory is an invisible cage of anguished sobs, gunshots, yelping howls, canine rib cages
exploding. sometimes we reminisce and notice that the bruises
of grief have turned pale like smoothed-over scars. that initial deep
hurt was the start, we found, of how love could die
right before us, even as we watched: stunned figures
pleading for mercy, urgent prayers saying, "let god's scribe mark this down. we've paid our dues. our hearts are inscribed
with loss after loss." for some reason, after everything, our rib cages
held up and continued to cradle tender hearts. they must have figured
that all the prayers and careful teachings would prevent bruises
that would weaken us. our love for those homely animals was deep and would figure in the knowledge that such bruises
aren't endless, and that our rib cages are not mere bones. one can die
from grief, so now we can describe loss and love as the holy twins.

for the graduates of the university of arizona. this morning we gather in gratitude for all aspects of sacredness:
the air, the warmth of fire, bodies of water, plants, the land,
and all animals and humankind.
we gather to honor our students who have achieved the extraordinary
accomplishment of earning doctoral or master's degrees.
we gather to honor their parents, grandparents, children,
family members, and friends who have traveled with them
on their path to success. they have traveled far distances to be here
this morning: we honor their devotion. may we remember that holiness exists in the ordinary elements of our lives. we are grateful for a homeland that has always thrived
on a glorious array of people and their diverse cultures, histories,
and beliefs. we acknowledge the generosity of the tohono o'odham
in granting this land on which we learn, teach, celebrate
accomplishments, and sometimes mourn losses. may we always cherish our ancestors as we prepare for the days ahead.
may we remember that we exist because of their prayers and their faith. we are blessed with distinct and melodious tongues.
our languages are treasures of stories, songs, ceremonies, and memories.
may each of us remember to share our stories with one another,
because it is only through stories that we live full lives. may the words we speak go forth as bright beads
of comfort, joy, humor, and inspiration.
we have faith that the graduates will inspire others
to explore and follow their interests. today we reflect a rainbow of creation:
some of us came from the east, where bright crystals of creativity reside.
they are the white streaks of early morning light when all is born again.
we understand that, in tucson, the rincon mountains are our inspiration
for beginning each day. the rincons are everlasting and always present. those who came from the south embody the strength of the blue
mountains that encircle us. the santa ritas instill in us
the vigorous spirit of youthful learning. others came from the west; they are imbued with the quiet, yellow glow of dusk.
they help us achieve our goals. here in the middle of the valley, the ts'aa',
the basket of life, the tucson mountains teach us to value our families. the ones from the north bring the deep, restorative powers of night's darkness;
their presence renews us. the santa catalina mountains teach us that,
though the past may be fraught with sorrow, it was strengthened
by the prayers of our forebearers.
we witnessed the recent fires the mountains suffered,
and in their recovery we see ourselves on our own journeys.
we understand that we are surrounded by mountains, dziił,
and thus that we are made of strength, dziił, nihí níhídziił.
we are strong ourselves. we are surrounded by mountains
that help us negotiate our daily lives. may we always recognize the multitude of gifts that surround us.
may our homes, schools, and communities be filled with the wisdom
and optimism that reflect a generous spirit. we are grateful for all blessings, seen and unseen. may we fulfill the lives envisioned for us at our birth. may we realize
that our actions affect all people and the earth. may we live in the way
of beauty and help others in need. may we always remember that
we were created as people who believe in one another. we are grateful,
holy ones, for the graduates, as they will strengthen our future. all is beautiful again.

for marilynnnihideezhí, it was a moist june afternoon when we buried you.
the oak springs valley was dense with sage, cedar, and chamisa;
and gray, green, and brown shrubs cradled the small cemetery.
the sky was huge overhead.
your son said later, "did you see the sky? it was purple.
i knew it would rain," he said. the dark carrizo mountains were so clear. there were so many people, sister.
many of your friends whom we didn't know,
and your former schoolmates whom we remembered as children,
and sister, we met many relatives for the first time. we cried, not wanting to leave you in that serene place.
we hesitated, though our father, his parents, and their parents
are buried there. our older sisters thought ahead to bring flowers for them.
they huddled quietly over their graves a few feet away. shideezhí, remember how red the sand is?
the men—your sons, our nephews, grandsons, and various in-laws—
took turns filling your grave. their necks and arms were streaked
with dusty sweat. they kept their heads down;
their faces were damp and eyes, swollen. we had to get it all out; we cried
and held each other. my granddaughters hovered near me
as if i might faint or fall unexpectedly. did you see, sister, the way the grandchildren fed and served everyone?
they guided the grandparents and the elderly to their chairs.
once seated, they served plates filled with mutton ribs,
potato salad, corn, thick slabs of oven bread, crispy fry bread,
and jell-o salad. they placed the salt and pepper—that enduring couple—
before us and implored us to eat. the two delights we relished were good—
hot, strong coffee and cold, crisp diet pop. we ate for you; we consumed your meal, shideezhí.
we ate to honor the times you cooked for us—
those tasty dishes, scrumptious pastries combined with laughter,
silly childhood memories, and always teasing jokes.
sister, i didn't know how we would make it;
it is still too much to think of you not being here.

we had a grief
we didn't understand while
standing at the edge of
some low scrub hills as if
humans were extra
or already gone;—what had been in us before?
a life that asks for mostly
wanting freedom to get things done
in order to feel less
helpless about the end
of things alone—;when i think of time on earth,
i feel the angle of gray minutes
entering the medium days
yet not "built-up": our
work together: groups, the willing
burden of an old belief,& beyond them love, as of
a great life going like fast
creatures peeling back marked
seeds, gold-brown integuments
the color time
will be when we are gone—

but how could one lose the self
after reading so much literary theory?
the shorter "i" stood under the cork trees,
the taller "i" remained rather passive;
the brendas were angry at the greed, angry
that the trees would die, had lost interest
in the posturing of the privileged, the gaps between can't & won't...
stood outside the gate of permissible
sound & the wind came soughing 
through the doubt debris(soughing comes from swāgh—to resound...
echo actually comes from this also—)
we thought of old hegel across
the sea—the weltgeist—& cloudswent by like the bones of a kleenex...
it's too late for countries
but it's not too late for trees...
& the wind kept soughing with its sound sash, wind with
its sound sash,
increasing
bold wind with its sound sash,
increasing bold—

very tired ,
i think
of extremophiles,
chemolithoautotrophs
& others with
power for changing
not-life into lives,
of those that eat rock
& fire in volcanoes,
before the death
of the world but after
the death of a human,
of their taste
for ammonia or iron ,
sulfur & carbon,
somehow
enough of it to go on ...
as workers
taste revolt,
they grow
at the vents of oceans,
turning mute vapor
into respiration,
changing unhinged
matter to hinges, near the rims of sea
trenches or the caves
...
our friend wrote
of writers livingin gray hiding,
of those who love glass
& early freedom,
steep sand
& late freedom,
sex among gentle
or bitter grasses,
those with a taste for
blue or belligerence,
obscure lives, she
called them,
the writers
of radical mind
…
the living prefer life
, mostly they do,
they are ravenous,
making shapes in groups
as the dying grow
one thought
until the end ,
wanting more
specifics,
desert or delay 
until the I drops away into i am not here ,
the mineral other
pumps & vast vapors,
ridges & shadows beyond
the single life it had not thought of—
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
perhaps is a new and sudden way of being. like satisfaction not yet begun or some other kind
of kindness: a more gentle one? night makes us all into the middle
of something until we aren' tanything anymore. the sky
isn't any color here. it's ok
because consolation is color enough or your cheeks, wind bitten and glorified
by the light of the wine in this glass draining toward a better time, a better space. i invented
a notion of hell, and you invented a notion of hello. amazing similarities and bizarrely coincidental snow like a twig falling from an oak's tallest point, i keep wondering when forgiveness
found its way into this world in a time before bargaining and beckoning. it's quiet again and now the sky is a tangled
mess of rags seeking out the bored and unwilling. i'd like to make a map not of the land
but of the path i took to arrive in this place, a map with no idealized purpose,
a map of a thousand airless pines.

shadows lengthened while we sat stuck in traffic just beyond san rafael. headlights had begun to flare in the cool dusk. the hum of the car's engine lulled me, and i put my forehead against the glass, looking out over a darkening landscape. we were headed to the bishop's ranch, a weekend retreat for episcopal young churchmen in hilly country that would someday produce superlative wines with garnet hues that stain the inside of a glass. i was queasy from the lurching of the car, the stops and starts, the smell of exhaust. though trembling with cold, i was too shy to ask the lady, the mother of one of the other girls, to turn on the heater. i imagined pale pink blossoms on the japanese plum, apple trees laden with white flowers, and north of sebastapol the vibrant yellow of daffodils on slender, pleated stems. that night i slept in a single bunk made up with thin sheets and blankets. a warm sun the next day restored me, but in the evening, seated by the fire that crackled in the fireplace of the big lodge, i felt flushed. our recently ordained curate (we were not to know he was gay till some years later) had asked me to bring my guitar, and now he wanted me to sing about the girl who decides to sleep next to her mother her whole life long instead of falling for an unfaithful suitor. i sang; we all sang together. young father w. had a wonderful tenor voice. his smile reassured me, but now i was tired and, earlier than the others, i decided to return to the dorm.in that clear march night, the sky gleamed like black ink and stars blazed, bright and alive. walking downhill, guitar in hand, i suddenly stumbled with dizziness, and the slope swam before me. “hold on, hold on,” i told myself as i nearly fell onto the dew-slick lawn. for a moment i could sense myself floating away from my body. back in the dorm, i crawled into bed and lay shuddering with cold, bones aching. the room seemed to spin. i wanted to be home, but the thought of facing my mother filled me with terrible dismay. i knew the blue failure notice mailed by the school would have arrived. sure enough, it lay open on the dining table when i got home the following afternoon. a sunday fog, hardly a mist, had blown in from the bay and was gathering in the eucalyptus across the ravine. the house was steamy. a basket of clean laundry occupied a chair atop a stack of san francisco chronicles. mom sat at the table sewing, but i knew she was scowling. i thought it wise to look industrious, so i began to fold towels and pillowcases. “what i want to know,” began my mother, “is whether you have any ambition? obviously, you will never get to college. what do you expect to do with your life?” she paused, and i shrugged. “go ahead and shrug. do you think your girlfriend is going to take care of you? that won’t last long. and why is it you only fall in love with girls? well, i suppose you want to be a boy.” what an unutterable failure i am. i retreated, burned by her ferocious, upright anger. “oh, yes, i’m sure you’re sick! but you will go to school tomorrow!” that night, wracked again with cold, unable to stop my trembling, i sought my parents’ bed, stood moaning till mom woke and let me under the covers, where she tried to warm me with her body. weeks later we learned that one of my classmates, a robust girl who shot baskets as well as any boy, had succumbed to the illness and died. that night, my mother placed her hand on my forehead–her smooth palm, her touch, gentle–and said to my barely awake dad, “our daughter has a raging fever.” like a miracle, i was still her child. comforted, i slept.

what might all songs lean into? you scramble eggs one moment,
and in the next minute you're eating them
with dry toast and black coffeein silence. on a day like any day,
your voice is not your own: the grass clippings disrupt a robin too large to fly
from worm to worm. we don't know why we speak, but yet our voices
persist, even when void of substance—
like a dream you'd like to recall throughout the day, but you don't or you can't
and after a week, it's gone forever .of course our voices
evolve years before our bodies—our vocal cords vibrate like a heartbeat,
senselessly. no explanation
needed. eventually all languages converge.
each thought falls into all others. and what thought
resists being built by words? perhaps fear placed us
here in this room together: a fear of fire at one point turned
into a fear of god. after that, a fear of godlessness, a room
where a word before another word and another word after the first
was all we had, all we could
imagine. somehow an image means
more than the object itself
but not because it's made of words. most likely
it's because the act of creation sets the mind down like a bird
in a field where the speed of the invasive cannot exist.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
if an idea exists but is never found,
then the stained-glass windowswill reflect nothing back to the ear.
most days filter through the mind, waiting not for movement
but for a road to be built, brick by brick, word by word, weariness replaced with joy,
but what is joy without the years and the way they open constantly,
two or three hearts pumping a volume of blood meant for just one? our disbelief in the ordinary
emerges from the way we color routine: leaves pile up depending on the wind,
but why pause to notice? eventually the seasons embrace
what our words will not, the illuminated day just one of a thousand others,
and the names we give back to the world mean ultimately little against the way the sun pleads sense
from the smallest cradle of dew.

all at once that stubborn dog of a heart
stopped barking at lady poetry, jumped
over the wall where the sacred crows of
kashmir dwelt and said: i've come into
this world to stay. it can't be, protested
the daffy nurses of pickapoon hospital.
it can't be, the guardians of the public
order responded in chorus. all at once
that heart stopped leaping, not in his
beloved buenos aires where he'd mis-
placed his violin for good or in ukraine
where josé sawed timber and memorized
train schedules. that stubborn dog of a
heart kept singing in the face of turbulence,
never knowing whether the lady would
arrive. he put bars on his verses because
of issues with his lungs and thanked the
little birds that ate from his hand. he fed
the crows as well—"breadcrumbing," he'd
call it—ringing a bell while quoting
mystics in their native tongues. this is
why i've come, he'd say, but all at once
that stubborn dog of a heart stopped
speaking and drew a giant moustache
high up in the spheres. you can see it

if someone tells you that your poem is nostalgic,
take it as a compliment. there's no greater
praise. in greek, nostos means "return" andalgia "pain." what's a poem without the return
of pain? if they tell you that your poem is
melancholic, take that as a compliment, too. in
greek, melan means "black" and khole "bile."
what's a poem without the most pernicious disorder
of the body and soul? pain and illness. if your
poem is nostalgic and melancholic, see a doctor.

there's no cause for vanity and none for
pride: it's just a matter of assembling
words in lines, then dividing them up (or
letting them divide themselves), hoping
they sound good or bad. (what's important
is that they sound like something.) it's all
a question of staying alert so that red doesn't
bleed into orange or orange into yellow or
yellow into silence. there's no cause for
rejecting silence and none for accepting it,
either. we should speak when there's noth-
ing to say and be quiet when others talk.
that's the poet's business, so get used to it.
there's nothing glorious about it. the future
doesn't count for anything and the past just
laughs at us. there's no cause for writing
this poem and none for deleting it, either.

empty air has its own mechanism, me dijo. 
its gears accord to whim. we go out only when we have to, me dijo. 
we have hidden things for breathing. you can't understand it prepped that way, me dijo. 
it always changes, but never readily enough. some things we say more of and then again, me dijo. 
they always mean less once pre-written. the context connections are far too frail, me dijo. 
to make them you need to pixel-point time. there are no click-in-n-out pictures, me dijo. 
you facet your eyes to see them multiply. there are hands held out everywhere, me dijo. 
we have to be careful what to step around/in. sometimes we come this close too late, me dijo. 
then we have to wait for inertia to embrace us. we are the hungry, hungry: so ravenous, me dijo. 
we will tear at your insides and lick them clean.

i would have come.
when you called. but.
i had the most beautiful pale pink rose.
its healthy stem was clenched between my teeth. and.
its thorns bit sharply into my tender wet flesh. so.i couldn't answer you. still.
my lips moved at you silently.
they offered words you never heard.
they screamed inside my crazed brain. only.
it could do nothing for you.in time the petals wilted.
they blew away. and.
they became compost in someone else's garden.
the tough, fibrous stem withered.
i bit down hard to snap its grip on me. then.my teeth fell out.
its thorns had burrowed into my cheeks.
they had implanted themselves permanently.
they were suckling on my softest tissues. and.
not long after they sprouted tiny shoots.they coiled their way down.
i still held the memory of your call. and.
the long stemmed beauty lodged next to it.
they cleaved unto the long roots curling down my neck.
my body held tight and listened. hard.

did you know there were hundreds of little
night moths
crowded against the window pane
to catch a glimmer of light? it was the scent of a strange perfume,
from fallen cocoons, sticky sincerity
that made them flee.in this world of protected ruins,
in this circular world
where people tell
and re-tell the same stories,
in this world where people forgot
that the dyke
wouldn't be massive enough to hold back
the sea swell;
in this world where each and every one
would flee in panic in the end;
even the old lady sold
spun silver birds
while she whispered...the tiny, translucent and elegant
night moths
like freshly picked pumpkin seeds
crowded in the corner of that half-open window
clinging to the cold glass,
light eager,
while the vapor filled the room
reaching the nostrils
of colleagues who didn't recognize each other
but intertwining their fingers,
waited for someone else's words
to atone
and explain
and bestow
meaning to words.

sharpening blades in the bathroom, her night.

bougainvilleas, birds of paradise...

yesterday i lost a country.
i was in a hurry,
and didn't notice when it fell from me
like a broken branch from a forgetful tree.
please, if anyone passes by
and stumbles across it,
perhaps in a suitcase
open to the sky,
or engraved on a rock
like a gaping wound,
or wrapped
in the blankets of emigrants,
or canceled
like a losing lottery ticket,
or helplessly forgotten
in purgatory,
or rushing forward without a goal
like the questions of children,
or rising with the smoke of war,
or rolling in a helmet on the sand,
or stolen in ali baba's jar,
or disguised in the uniform of a policeman
who stirred up the prisoners
and fled,
or squatting in the mind of a woman
who tries to smile,
or scattered
like the dreams
of new immigrants in america.
if anyone stumbles across it,
return it to me, please.
please return it, sir.
please return it, madam.
it is my country. . .

shook the box like a maraca. stood around like a dope in my punch-colored dress, clutching your box
to my chest. opened your plastic receptacle, the size of a jack-in-the-box. but instead
of gaudy stripes, your box is sober-suit blue, hymnal blue. tasted them. you've gained a statue's flavor, like licking the pyramids, or
kissing sandstone shoulders. i mean boulders. remarked to your box: "reincarnation comes from roots meaning 'to
be made flesh again.'" stowed your box under my bed for a week to seed dreams in which you
advise me. (this didn't work.)opened the babylonian talmud at random. read aloud to your gritty,
gray-white powder: "there are three keys which the holy one, blessed be
he, has not entrusted into the hands of any messenger. these are: the key
of rain, the key of birth, and the key of the resurrection of the dead."
worked myself up to watery eyes. any intensity evaporated the instant i
stopped reading. tried to intuit your format, sift it from tides of void. does shape play a
role? my watch ticked in an exaggerated way. closed my eyes, sent forth
mental tendrils seeking the nothing of you. they curled back on them-
selves, weaving around the wing chair, a dog's leg, a lamp stand, eventu-
ally heading back toward the nothing of me.

the dissonance of women. the shrill frilly silly
drippy prissy pouty fuss of us. and all the while
science was the music of our minds. our sexual
identities glittery as tinsel, we fretted about god's
difficulties with intimacy, waiting for day's luster
to fade so we could slip into something less
venerated. like sea anemones at high tide
our minds snatched at whatever rushed by.
hush, hush, my love. these things happened

puerto rico was created when the pumpkin on top of

crucifix in one hand, arquebus in the other, sucking
the veins of land and men, tossing the pulp into the
compost heap which they used as the foundation for
their fortifications and other vainglorious temples. puerto rico was arrested just as it broke out of the
spanish jail and, renamed a trusty, it was put in an
american cell. when the prisoner hollered, "yankee, go
home," puerto rico was referred to the united nations. puerto rico, to get to paradise now, you have to ride blood.

the alternating flow of breath,

what a surprise it is to hear
that locusts come the thirteenth year
and not the seventeenth as told
for ages and enshrined in old
folklore and rhymes and family lies.
the species similar otherwise:
cicadas books call periodic,
found here in our southern district.
they grow from eggs pressed into twigs.
the nymphs that hatch then start to dig
at least ten inches into soil,
and live by sucking juicy oil
from roots and stems, sweet sap
that nourishes through the giant nap,
and then the lucky thirteenth year
they grow a polished armor
and crawl into the summer air
and, louder than a mahler choir,
fill meadow, hedge, and orchard grove
with necessary calls for love,
then leave their eggs to fortune's whim
with philip glass-like requiem.

he brings me cocoa powder, like chocolate blown

i can enter the morning with traces of an eternal dream: to live
on a planet of women. we sing in the fertile forest, caress on
lavender hills, bathe beneath cascades of clear waters. and just
like that, nude and wet, we mount each other’s bodies. our
desire is a whale that searches for calm in the depth of the sea. i smell sex in my hair when i awaken. the dream perfumes all of my days. i go to the post office and
look for stamps with etchings of flowers and fruits so that i can
send letters to the women who loved me in my sleep. we are in a world that is not ours. what do we do with the
dreams that touch our consciousness in the nude each night? our planet of women is nothing more than a dream. who knows
how many of us bathe in the woods or which ones of us have
wings that let us fly with our flesh? it’s not for anyone to know.
fortunately, we always dream paradise, we make it ours. there,
we find each other and live in our collective memory. and so, i smell sex in my hair when i awaken.

for those of us who live at the shoreline
standing upon the constant edges of decision
crucial and alone
for those of us who cannot indulge
the passing dreams of choice
who love in doorways coming and going
in the hours between dawns
looking inward and outward
at once before and after
seeking a now that can breed
futures
like bread in our children’s mouths
so their dreams will not reflect
the death of ours; for those of us
who were imprinted with fear
like a faint line in the center of our foreheads
learning to be afraid with our mother’s milk
for by this weapon
this illusion of some safety to be found
the heavy-footed hoped to silence us
for all of us
this instant and this triumph
we were never meant to survive. and when the sun rises we are afraid
it might not remain
when the sun sets we are afraid
it might not rise in the morning
when our stomachs are full we are afraid
of indigestion
when our stomachs are empty we are afraid
we may never eat again
when we are loved we are afraid
love will vanish
when we are alone we are afraid
love will never return
and when we speak we are afraid
our words will not be heard
nor welcomed
but when we are silent
we are still afraid so it is better to speak
remembering
we were never meant to survive.

something bad will happen. don’t worry,
i say, all will be well. how could she know? she’s never
read it, never heard of elizabeth
and jane, never wanted mr. darcy. like me she needs to know how things will end.
i know elizabeth will be fine. as i knew,
last week, my sister weeping, that elinor–sobbing, begging–wouldn’t lose marianne.
it’s jane austen! my sister doesn’t know that
in austen nothing really bad happens. i leave heron the couch with the last hours.

what a relief to yield to the exit
sign red “i” blinking like a candle. soon the enormous figures moving
across rooms, the emphatic narrative
arcs. (there’s the thrum of the subway, its engine of extras.) here now
the beginning of trivia tests. warning puppets
with brown-bag faces and fringy hair. you’re almost here. but what you want
is the after. how yourself you are now
walking into the night, full moon over houston street, at the bright fruit stand touching the yellow

have heard movie paper. apples are more apples.

my cousin, milton, worked for a cable company.
the boy i knew when we were children had fists that were often clenched, his face set like
an old man whose life had been so hard, it hardened him. but the man's hands opened to let
more of the world in. he sent the funniest cards to family and friends at christmas, laid down
cable so others could connect. yet, he lived alone, kept to himself much of the time, so when
his sister found his body, he'd been gone a good while. he died young at fifty-seven, without
fuss or bother. no sitting by the bedside or feeding him soup. he just laid himself down like

i'm just an assistant with the vanishing act.
my spangled wand points out the disappeared.
it's only a poor thing made of words, and lacks
the illusive power to light the darkling year. not prophecy, not elegy, but fact:
the thing that's gone is never coming back. late or soon a guttering silence will ring down
a curtain like woven smoke on thickening air.
the audience will strain to see what's there,
the old magician nowhere to be found. for now, i wear a costume and dance obliquely.
the applause you hear is not for me, its rabid sound
like angry rain—as one by one the known forms cease to be:
childhood, the farm, the river, forested ground;
the tiger and the condor, the whale, the honeybee;
the village, the book, the lantern. then you. then me.

last night, i went to a gay bar
with a man i love a little.
after dinner, we had a drink.
we sat in the far-back of the big backyard
and he asked, what will we do when this place closes?
i don't think it's going anywhere any time soon, i said,
though the crowd was slow for a saturday,
and he said—yes, but one day. where will we go?
he walked me the half-block home
and kissed me goodnight on my stoop—
properly: not too quick, close enough
our stomachs pressed together
in a second sort of kiss.
i live next to a bar that's not a gay bar
—we just call those bars, i guess—
and because it is popular
and because i live on a busy street,
there are always people who aren't queer people
on the sidewalk on weekend nights.
just people, i guess.
they were there last night.
as i kissed this man i was aware of them watching
and of myself wondering whether or not they were just.
but i didn't let myself feel scared, i kissed him
exactly as i wanted to, as i would have without an audience,
because i decided many years ago to refuse this fear—
an act of resistance. i left
the idea of hate out on the stoop and went inside,
to sleep, early and drunk and happy.
while i slept, a man went to a gay club
with two guns and killed forty-nine people.
today in an interview, his father said he had been disturbed
recently by the sight of two men kissing.
what a strange power to be cursed with:
for the proof of men's desire to move men to violence.
what's a single kiss? i've had kisses
no one has ever known about, so many
kisses without consequence—
but there is a place you can't outrun,
whoever you are.
there will be a time when.
it might be a bullet, suddenly.
the sound of it. many.
one man, two guns, fifty dead—
two men kissing. last night
i can't get away from, imagining it, them,
the people there to dance and laugh and drink,
who didn't believe they'd die, who couldn't have.
how else can you have a good time?
how else can you live?
there must have been two men kissing
for the first time last night, and for the last,
and two women, too, and two people who were neither.
brown people, which cannot be a coincidence in this country
which is a racist country, which is gun country.
today i'm thinking of the bernie boston photograph
flower power, of the vietnam protestor placing carnations
in the rifles of the national guard,
and wishing for a gesture as queer and simple.
the protester in the photo was gay, you know,
he went by hibiscus and died of aids,
which i am also thinking about today because
(the government's response to) aids was a hate crime.
now we have a president who names us,
the big and imperfectly lettered us, and here we are
getting kissed on stoops, getting married some of us,
some of us getting killed.
we must love one another whether or not we die.
love can't block a bullet
but neither can it be shot down,
and love is, for the most part, what makes us—
in orlando and in brooklyn and in kabul.
we will be everywhere, always;
there's nowhere else for us, or you, to go.
anywhere you run in this world, love will be there to greet you.
around any corner, there might be two men. kissing.

before clock hands showed the time
time ceased, and looking glasses
were veiled as if they still held

the dying left death-beds borne
on the arms of the gathered,

through which to listen and know
the earth's old secrets before

lost wages or fingers the risk of reflection. or another recalled in those reckoning moments
remembering the mountains the hardscrabble farm
where a workday as long bought no guarantee

beasts of burden in the fur trade

left for white-melting-skinned women,

from a black and white page

townsfolk who 'believed native girls were easy'
and 'less likely to complain if a sexual proposition led to violence. 'betty, if i write this poem.

the story goes from in a rainfall
to sister walking a field
browned autumn. and when she arrives
winter has come, so the old man
rises from his chair, picks up
matches, pipes and tools, and
walks out to begin again. the sculptures grow by the day,
birds in ice, recognizable
eagles, a bear who began
as a man in a moment of dance.
he does this in ice, all
winter carving at dawn,
carving at dusk. and sister after walking a field
browned autumn, arrives, watches
from the east window, waits,
goes out to him in spring,
taps him on the shoulder
and points to the pools
of water he's standing over.

more than a hundred dollars of them.it was pure folly. i had to find more glass things to stuff
them in. now a white and purple cloud is breathing in each corner of the room i love. now a mass of flowers spills down my
dining table—each fresh-faced, extending delicate leaves into the crush. didn't i watch children shuffle strictly in line, cradle candles that dribbled hot white on their fingers, chanting latin—just to fashion sevilla's easter? wasn't i sad?
didn't i use to go mucking through streambeds with the skunk cabbage
raising bursting violet spears?—look, the afternoon dies as night begins in the heart of the lilies and smokes up their fluted throats until it fills the room and my lights have to be not switched on. and in close darkness the aroma grows so sweet, so strong, that it could slice me open. it does. i know i'm not the only one whose life is a conditional clause hanging from something to do with spring and one tall room
and the tremble of my phone. i'm not the only one that love makes feel like a dozen flapping bedsheets being ripped to prayer flags by the wind. when i stand in full sun i feel i have been falling headfirst for
decades. god, i am so transparent.so light.

admiral laid out on vellum, the past
is a long wound. it unfolds
five centuries later,
beneath the heavy pens of scholars.
the world shifts and spins
as the admiral's bronze astrolabe
measures the paths between stars.
the sky is written in the sea's
uneasy mirror, and mermaids
comb their hair in the distance. they are not, he writes, so beautiful as i have heard. he dreams of his own
circuitous route to the heavens.
god and the crown. both want too much. governor at guanahani, they swam to the caravel
bearing parrots and balls of cotton thread,
these people so unlike him they could not
not be saved.
too angry to sleep,
the governor haunts every room in his castle.
the servants whisper in their own tongue. the severed hands of the taino
wave in clear salt water,
in pink-tinted water.
they wave as the gold mines dry up,
as the governor leaves hispaniola in chains. mermaids, dog-headed men and women
with breastplates of copper—
they draw their bows, and arrows
cover the shore of columbus's dream.
no, not the taino, whom he once called in dios.
they touch his white skin.
they have the faces of christian angels.

the people who watch me hang my coat
on a peg at the office don't even know
about that other life,
the life when there was you, it,
however briefly. to them my body
is a fact casual as the weather.
i could tell them:
that day it rained
the way it rains in the new world.
leaves struck the window like daggers.
i didn't think about god
but the ones we used to worship
the ones who want your heart still
beating, who load you with gold
and lure you to sleep
deep in the cenote.

though we couldn't have known.
i would have left him then
for ten thousand pesos.
i don't know what world you inhabit,
swimming there, baby, not-baby,
part of my body, not me,
swept aside like locks of hair
or toenail parings.
it's ten years today
and you who were never alive
pull a face in the leaves
of jacaranda, the only tree
that lives outside my window.
it must be your voice
whistling through the office window,
though i can't understand your words.

how can we die when we're already
prone to leaving the table mid-meal
like ancient ones gone to breathe
elsewhere. salt sits still, but pepper's gone
rolled off in a rush. we've practiced dying
for a long time: when we skip dance or town,
when we chew. we've rounded out
like dining room walls in a canyon, eaten
through by wind—sorry we rushed off;
the food wasn't ours. sorry the grease sits
white on our plates, and the jam that didn't set—
use it as syrup to cover every theory of us.

—horoscope first you must lift the idea
(be careful it may be heavy)
and haul it out to the dumpster.
next locate the meaning—it may not
come easily, though if you have
the right tools and they are good tools
you should have no difficulty. now
it is the sentences' turn: take each one
strip it of grammar (you may need
abrasives here) and hang them all
on a line. when thoroughly dried,
lay each one down on the grass or
if you live in the city, the sidewalk will do.
the point is, make sure you put them
in harm's way, wherever you are.
don't try to protect them. it may be
they will go to war, or wander the desert
or haunt the streets like beggars
or run from the police or suffer
loneliness and despair. remember:
they must make their own way. the best
you can do is to stay out of theirs
and take them back in if they return.

this is a paean to relief and ecstasy.
a man's poem of course—the electric ah!
in the long stream arcing a rainbow
under the spotlight moon, a covenant between
mv body and the earth's.
i think of li po smiling
silently on green mountain and can hear rumi
drunk on rapture—drink my brother he calls to me,
think of the elephant loosening a great ebullient
stream that floats a river past your house and drop
turds so immense you could build a hut from them
along the shore to shelter your children.
what release!
think of your child pedaling under your hand
and of a sudden—it just happens—you let go
and he's off on his own, free for that first time—
the achieve of, the mastery of the child.
see the stalwart trees in their silence
the stones resting in the driveway, the cat curled asleep
on the front porch, the smear of blood
on the lion's mouth sitting over his fresh gazelle
the morning paper and its stories shouting
for attention. the plenitude of it all.
and perhaps
somewhere a friend is dreaming of me, or someone
a stranger is peeing ecstatic under the same moon.
a covenant then between us.
true or not. it is no matter.

steaming like a crab
luscious under the shell televisions gone bleary
blinked
in front of men
in undershirts drinking beer wives upstairs took showers
caught
a glimpse of their backs
in hallway mirrors i sat in the dark
invisible
on the backporch
drinking in the night and it tasted good
so good

recall her flit and armored crawl.
to the last breath of summer.
upon the circular of winter. the man may have left.
this doesn't stop
the writing. between
the pages, a slight blur.
the man may have been old
and ill, or young
who stopped trying
to be with you.

my ancestors were not diligent
and so they lived beside the fort
that's neither on the maps of heaven,
nor of hell.
in these lands, there is no difference
between a star and thrown car keys.
chicken nuggets hatch from the eggs of eagles.
i grow dirty while bathing in bottled water.
my bed comforter is a wet parking lot,
i wrap myself up in.
if i eat in the morning, there's nothing left in the evening
my dish of grass and cigarette butts topped with expired coupons.
stir all i like; i never swallow it down.
all the while, my rabbit's foot runs about
from las cruces to west memphis
searching for flawless luck.
the more one cries, the more one prospers . . .

or the queen's royal crown signature
izzy juju—hijacked, forsaking all others.
the untamed scotch is mine. it cost the picture a fortune
to say nothing of my turban, costume copies
of topaz bracelets, the umpteenth translation.

i carry my spikes and step on the field an hour ahead of the others. last day of march with april offering tickets for the new season. i'm full of sun on wet grass, in love with blistered benches. a sparrow sits on the backstop, watching, ready to dart if i catch its eye. i drop my bag on home plate and swirl my foot in the dust the way my cousin does with his fingers on the skin of a drum head. next year he'll be released with the others who spent mornings breaking windows and trashing vacation homes like drunks in the right field bleachers. here, i'm alone with a sparrow and the smell of a baseball morning settling around me like a comforter. i start trotting to first base, the ankles loosening, then the knees, as the dust begins to lift into the breaking light. around second and third i stretch my arms in a rotary motion ready to fly. a hand waves back from a passing car, someone who knows me or remembers rising one morning when the game of who you are is played out in your mind, and around you a stadium full of fans begs you to do what you usually do in the clutch. the bat i pull from the bag for the first time is my father's louisville slugger, thirty-three inches, wood barrel. i thought enough time had passed, the attic dust hard in the grooves. i stroke it slowly like a weapon you love to touch but would never use. he hit .304 at omaha the season he was drafted, all-star rookie-of-the-year. he said we'd join him soon. then that other draft. he would have been here. i swear he would. the silence feels oppressive now. i dig for a scuffed ball and throw it up, shoulder high, but let it fall. a natural hitter, my father said, holding my hands. i grip the tar-stained handle. tears blur the wall that's so far away it looks warped. i aim for marrow deep inside, april hungry for the kill.

there are too many of us for you to believe you are either alone or responsible. no woman asks for this. some are children. some are boys. every one of us should have been heard. this is for anna, age 17,who was then beaten and left to die; for nathan, who at 11 admired the basketball coach; for rosaline, who sees in her baby the face of a rapist and who finds that face difficult to love; for sisters when soldiers came, mothers imprisoned among guards, for aunties grandmas daughters sons, for one who was tied and one who tried to scream, one whose husband watched, one violated time after time, one torn apart, who called the police who did not call her back, who went to the clinic where there were no kits, who numbed her shame with drugs, who could not drink enough to forget, who took her life, who believed she was an object, who said nothing, who knew no one was there and that no one would ever be there. know this: there are so many that if we could speak, our voices might spread like floodwaters over their boots and swell past security stations; that if we cried out together we might finally understand it as an assault on all people, all creation, and maybe then there would be justice in this war to claim yourself, a struggle mapped all over the flesh of every woman or child who has known what it is to be used, as you were, your sacred body.

all this time i've been looking for words for certain difficult women because they aren't able to speak for themselves, and now the clinton foundation has come up with a brilliant campaign—they decided, for international women's day, through digital magic to erase women on the cover of condé nast, posters, billboards, those figures replaced by empty space because women have not yet achieved gender equity, as noted on a website, not-there.org, and they're right. we haven't. but when i read about not-there.org and saw its flashy graphics, i wasn't thinking about how women are not-there-yet, metaphorically, i just thought about women who are really not there, women and girls who keep disappearing (not from magazines, who don't make news in manhattan)like they've evaporated, like illusions, hundreds in juárez, twelve hundred missing and murdered native women across canada. the hands of men. now you see her. not. not-there. not here, either, or anywhere. maybe only part of the problem is the predatory perpetrator-prestidigitator who more often than not knows her, knows how to keep her quiet, who may claim to love her, even, maybe getting even—or the serial rapist-killer in the bushes who bushwhacks her in the dark. you're always safe, says the forensic psychiatrist, unless a monster happens to show up, and then you're not. not-there. maybe a lonely mandible, maxilla, fibula, or ulna shows up, or a bagged body gets dragged from the river. or not. is this the value we permit a woman's life to have (or not-have) throughout a wrong world, a global idea of her as disposable parts? in the end, this is not a xenophobic poem, not specific—it's everywhere. not-there. right here. yes, the sun rises anyway, but now the parents are staring past each other, that zero between them like a chalked outline in their family photograph. or not.

after a while the 500-year-old village became a secret, carved into the wall of the forest where it met the pacific, eleven long houses and their racks of drying fish, their dogs. no roads to this town, only boats and the memory of boaters. blankets made from woodpecker feathers, cattail fluff, cedar bark and dog hair woven into a plaid pattern.at least that's what i remember of the museum's diorama. when the mud came down the mountain and covered the village, no one had lived there for years. it was a boater who remembered, after a while, that the village was gone, and also that it had once existed. archaeologists brought garden hoses to wash the mud off and hooked the hoses up to the sea. some of what had been preserved in the mud was destroyed that day by the water pressure, and then later most else was ruined by the wind and rain, but at least fora few weeks they could hold the bones in their hands. the archaeologists brought their dogs, they lived there a while.

& fizzle of fireworks launched at the flat lozenge of the moon, a ghostly azure, suspended low
above the sweep of the cantilevered roofs
on the opposite shoreline–the poured concrete ,the glass towers, the obelisks–a costly parody
of bygone days when confidence in the future, evinced
by our sixty miles of integrated mills, was illustrated by a time capsule, a chamber “hermetically” sealed
in steel city alloys, bicentennially filled with newsprint
& artifacts of 1958 pittsburgh to be cracked open& savored in some distant epoch, an idea first
embraced by esarhaddon, son of sennacherib, king
of assyria, babylonia, & egypt, & reenacted now in waves of sound & light–the roar of fireworks night
for a losing franchise, the hoarse voices of pittsburghers–
wafting into the void, accelerated by jupiter’s pull,& then hurled by jupiter out of the solar system,
yet another urban missive from a noisy planet,
a comingling of mathematics and human music, charming& powerful, a murmur preserved of our city-state

my mother keeps this silence also.
four times my father was on strike,
and according to my mother; had nothing
to say. she says the company didn’t understand,
nor can her son, the meaning
of an extra fifteen cents an hour in 1956
to a man tending a glass furnace in august. i have always remembered him a tired man.
i have respected him like a guest
and expected nothing.
it is april now.
my life lies before me,
enticing as the woman at my side.
now, in april, i want him to speak.
i want to stand against the worn body
of his pain. i want to try it on
like a coat that does not fit.

someone is looking for us.
i sensed it earlier at the creek
while floating on my back, and again
on route 8 near brookline.
so we’ve detoured to this hillside
eroding and crazy with markers.
we’re looking for row mm or nn
or something like that.
i lug the baby; my wife runs ahead.
this neighborhood knows her–
she passes so easily between stones.
she finds the grave, her father
dead ten years now. in the time it takes
to say kaddish the sun’s dropped.
i set down my son
and he crawls in the dimness,
pulling himself up on the headstone.
how delicately he fingers the marble.
quickly he rounds its corner. vanishes.
i’m thinking: grass, stone, quiet–
then babbling from another world.

does my little son miss the smell
of his first mother? i wonder
as the mewl of his mouth
opens toward a plastic bottle
that is not her breast. sudden new mother,
i bury my nose deep
into his skullcap of ringlets,
his starry cheesiness.in her good-bye letter to him
sealed in his album
with a birth certificate, which now
list my name as mother, his first mother writes
she nursed him briefly
after he emerged into
the second room of his world. i think of milk, volcanic
and insistent, answering
the newborn’s gigantic thirst,
a primal agreement between
generosity and greed. sometimes i press my nose
to the glass of that place
where a mother and my child
belong to each other;
i cannot imagine coming
between them. but then i want to lick him all over
with a cow’s thick tongue,
to taste him and mark him as mine
so if the other mother returns,
she will refuse her handled calf
smeared with my smell.

the bus steps are high, but william clambers up gamely.
doors shut. he peers out a print-marked window.
from the street corner, i wave, wistful as a soldier’s bride
as his bus pulls away and turns a corner.at noon the yellow bus returns him
to the same place where i’m standing again.
he thinks i stood there all day, waiting in his absence.
when he finds out i left to play tennis, his forehead crumples like paper in a wastebasket.
now he knows i can move on my own without him.
tears drawn from the well of desertion form in his eyes.
i’m his first love and his greatest disappointment.

the roman candle of a yard light
caramelizes the old snow.
the glow trespasses the dark hold
of december, dimming the view of the night sky with its winter
triangle a boy strains to see
through the haze, as he lets his jacket
hang open, unzipped to the cold. he knows to return through
the black cleft between buildings,
below electric wires that seem
to carry a little train of snow on their slim rails, where he throws
the switch that shuts off the bulb
on its pole, that opens the dome
to a blast of stars in outer space, to the pinpoint of jupiter,
to the constellation of orion hunting
the great bear that the boy follows
to find a smudge of gray–he can gaze through that peep hole to another
galaxy also spangled with radiance
from stars that traveled two
and a half million light years before appearing as a signal
in the rod cells of his eyes
that pass impulses through
neurons and nerves to his brain that creates images.
he draws in a sharp breath,
the high voltage power box
of his chest hot and humming.

once again, someone falls in their first falling–fall of two bodies, of two eyes, of four green eyes or eight green eyes if we count those born in the mirror (at midnight, in the purest fear, in the loss), you haven’t been able to recognize the voice of your dull silence, to see the earthly messages scrawled in the middle of one mad state, when the body is a glass and from ourselves and from the other we drink some kind of impossible water.
desire needlessly spills on me a cursed liqueur. for my thirsty thirst, what can the promise of eyes do? i speak of something not in this world. i speak of someone whose purpose is elsewhere.
and i was naked in memory of the white night. drunk and i made love all night, just like a sick dog.
sometimes we suffer too much reality in the space of a single night. we get undressed, we’re horrified. we’re aware the mirror sounds like a watch, the mirror from which your cry will pour out, your laceration.
night opens itself only once. it’s enough. you see. you’ve seen. fear of being two in the mirror, and suddenly we’re four. we cry, we moan, my fear, my joy more horrible than my fear, my visceral words, my words are keys that lock me into a mirror, with you, but ever alone. and i am well aware what night is made of. we’ve fallen so completely into jaws that didn’t expect this sacrifice, this condemnation of my eyes which have seen. i speak of a discovery: felt the i in sex, sex in the i. i speak of burying everyday fear to secure the fear of an instant. the purest loss. but who’ll say: you don’t cry anymore at night? because madness is also a lie. like night. like death.

my hands hold, my father’s older the wires–
picture rolls once, then steadies… an english castle!
a voice-over drones about edward i,
who, to subdue the welsh, built castles.
some sixty years, dozens of engineers, the masses
conscripted from the villages.my father moves on to a zenith
with a bad tuner. tvs interest him, not english
with their damp, historical programming.*
*
*here there were indians, mound builders.
here, an english fort, a few farmers.
and here the industrialist settled his ass,
john ford on the river dredging sand
for making glass. plate glass.
(why should america buy from europe?)
some half dozen years, german engineers, and hundreds of slavic peasants. grandfather sat on his samovar
warming himself and making excuses,
but finally, he set off.
got a room, became a shoveler.
got a wife, a company house.
ford city: a valley filling with properties.no one got along–
not labor and capital, not germans and slavs,
not husband and wives, for that matter.
edward’s castles were ruins
by the fifteenth century. not from welsh armies,
but the rise of the middle class.
the towns around a castle thrived:
tailors, smithies, cobblers, coopers.
drawing in the welsh peasants.
and what with intermarriage and the rise of capitalism…
a castle grew obsolescent. i turn off the set. my father hunts
cigarettes at the kwik-mart on the corner.
overhead, my mother’s footsteps,
the tonk of bottles,
the scraping of plates.
during eisenhower’s reign
my grandfather retired and mowed his lawn
until i took over. he primed the filter,
set the choke, then we took turns pulling
till the sputtering engine caught.
(“somanabitch,” he spit)
and watched me as i mowed
back and forth for two dollars. once in the garage he showed me a scythe.
he mowed hay in the old country, and the women
would follow, raking it in windrows.
the factories today are mostly closed down,
or full of robots or far off in asia.
ford city lives through the mail:
compensation, a thin pension,
and, of course, social security. i always drive along the factory, windows rolled down;
i want my kids in the back seat to see.
seven or eight, probably pensioners, congregate
on the corner, each man dressed quite alike:
sears jacket, cigarette, salt-and-pepper hair. “honk the horn,” my oldest begs.
he waves and waves zealously
until a man turns–a man
with my face, but full of sweetness now,
silence and clarity.

all night i hear the noise of water sobbing. all night i make night in me, i make the day that begins on my account, that sobs because day falls like water through night.
all night i hear the voice of someone seeking me out. all night you abandon me slowly like the water that sobs slowly falling. all night i write luminous messages, messages of rain, all night someone checks for me and i check for someone.
the noise of steps in the circle near this choleric light birthed from my insomnia. steps of someone who no longer writhes, who no longer writes. all night someone holds back, then crosses the circle of bitter light.
all night i drown in your eyes become my eyes. all night i prod myself on toward that squatter in the circle of my silence. all night i see something lurch toward my looking, something humid, contrived of silence launching the sound of someone sobbing.
absence blows grayly and night goes dense. night, the shade of the eyelids of the dead, viscous night, exhaling some black oil that blows me forward and prompts me to search out an empty space without warmth, without cold. all night i flee from someone. i lead the chase, i lead the fugue. i sing a song of mourning. black birds over black shrouds. my brain cries. demented wind. i leave the tense and strained hand, i don’t want to know anything but this perpetual wailing, this clatter in the night, this delay, this infamy, this pursuit, this inexistence.
all night i see that abandonment is me, that the sole sobbing voice is me. we can search with lanterns, cross the shadow’s lie. we can feel the heart thud in the thigh and water subside in the archaic site of the heart.
all night i ask you why. all night you tell me no.

the wall of identical boxes into which
our aunt sticky sorted the daily mail
was at the far end of her dining room,
and from the private side looked like
a fancy wallpaper upon which peonies
pushed through a white wooden trellis,
or sometimes like crates of chickens
stacked all the way to the ceiling.
i'd learned by then – i was a little boy –
that a thing can look like one thing
on one day and another on another,
depending on how you might be feeling.
there were times when we were there,
having our coffee and sweet rolls,
when some woman on the lobby side
would with a click unlock her box
and leaning down, peer inside to see
if she had mail, and see us at the table,
mother and father, my sister and i
and our postmistress aunt, and call out,
"yoohoo, sticky! i see you have company!"
and waggle her fingers, waving hello.

after a funeral, they were covered with black cloth,
some draped with shawls like a scalloped valance.
leftover sewing scraps, wool, linen, synthetic,
anything to shroud the odd-shaped mirrors,
though sometimes a corner was exposed like a woman
whose ankle peeks forbidden from under a long skirt. a mourner must shun vanity during shiva, focusing inward
but as a child i wondered if this were to avoid ghosts,
for don't the dead take their time leaving?
i'm of a generation where grandparents disappeared,
great aunts with european accents,
rarely an explanation provided to us children.my mother died too young.
with a baby in arms i couldn't bear to fling
that dark cloth over the glass.
after all she had come back from the dead so often,
even the doctors could not explain it.
each time i looked in a mirror my mother gazed back.
i could never tell if she were trying to tell me something
or to take the baby with her.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
in the evening she comes to me
like a child ready for bed.
she slips under covers, curls
into my curves or stretches against
my spine. some have said they fear
i might crush her, but we're a tender
pair, each aware of the warmth
and the other. i knew a woman once who kept
an orphaned antelope, let it
roam her kitchen, sleep in her bed,
musky scent and hooves. this dog looks like a small deer,
poised and silent in the lawn,
but at night, she is a dark body, lean
and long against the lavender cotton
of my summer sleeping. we are bone
and bone, muscle and muscle,
and underneath each surface
a quiet and insistent pulse.

the ground cracked
like the rough pit of a peach
and snapped in two.
the sun behind the mountains
turned into an olive-green glow.to niña gloria this was home.
she continued to sell her bowl of lemons,
rubbing a cold, thin silver christ
pocketed in her apron. others
like lito and marvin played
soldiers in the ruins of a school,
running around mounds of bricks,
shooting chickens and pigs.no one knows exactly how
a light film of ash appeared
on everyone’s eyelids
early in the morning
or how trout and mackerel plunged from the sky,
twitched, leaped through the streets. some say the skin of trees
felt like old newspaper, dry and yellow.
others believe the soapsuds
washed aside in rivers
began to rise in their milk. one monday morning, a rain fell
and the cemetery washed into the city.
bones began to knock
and knock at our doors.
streets became muddy rivers
waiting for bodies to drop
among piles of dead fish.in a year, everyone stabbed flowers on a grave. this explains why women thought
and moved like lizards under stones,
why men heard bees buzzing inside their skulls,
why dogs lost their sense of smell
sniffing piles of rubble to get back home.in a few years, no one cared
about turtles banging their heads against rocks,
bulls with their sad, busted eyes,
parrots that kept diving into creeks,
the dark swelling of the open ground
or at night a knife
stained the kitchen cloth. instead, niña gloria swept the ground,
the broom licking her feet at each stroke.at the bus station, marvin shined
military boots,
twenty-five cents a pair,
reduced his words to a spit, a splutter
of broken sentences
on shoe polish, leather.in the evenings, he counted coins
he’d tossed in a jar, then walked home,
one step closer to the cracked bone
clenched in the yellow jaw of a dog.

as i punch the time-clock, i know
men will be gunned down at dawn
in a distant continent, someone
will dart into a café with a bomb nestled in the belly, by the roadside a woman
will moan over the body of a man,
shrunken, stretched on the earth, that god
will finger the forehead of a dying country, all of it funneled through the news on tv.
but tonight, instead of tuning in, i’m going to kneel
beside the window, recognize myself
in the croak of the crow, high above the black tree of winter, claws hooked and rough, wings swept
back and hunched, face masked with exhaust.
i’m going to try, even if i fail, to see myself whole,
complete in the cry, in the beak of the crow.

on the pan american highway, somewhere
between the north and south continent,
you come across a chain of volcanoes, a coast with a thick growth of palm trees,
crunching waves of the sea; an isthmus
neruda called “slender earth like a whip.” when the road bends, turns into a street,
the walls splattered with “yanqui go home!!!”
you see a boy fifteen years old, barefoot, sniffing glue in a small plastic bag.
an old woman in an apron will step out,
say, “this is the right street.” in the public square, there will be no friend
from school to welcome you, no drive
to sonsonate, city of coconuts, no one to order cold pilseners, oyster
cocktails, or convince the waitress
into dancing a cumbia or two with you. instead, at the local bar, you’ll raise
a bottle next to strangers, stub
your cigarette out on the floor. you’ll watch a country ten years
after the civil war: an old man sitting
on the curb, head between knees, open hand stretched out.
everything will hurt, your hair,
your toenails, even your shoes. you’ll curse dusty streets, demented
sun slowly burning the nape of your neck,
stray dogs following you to the park.by nightfall, you drag yourself back to the bars,
looking for a lost country in a shot of tíc táck.
against the wall, three men with their guitars. when you lie on a hotel bed,
too tired to sleep, when you feel torn,
twisted like an old newspaper, blown from city to city, you have reached the place.
you have begun to speak like a man
by the side of the road, barefoot.

after seven lean years
we are promised seven fat ones,
if the cows do not die first.
some care must be taken
to prevent their demise
in the scrub
or the slaughterhouse.
there must be enough bones
to throw and to bury. the skull of a cow,
i put it on.
there are many strewn in the field,
there has not been much rain.
i look through the eyes,
that is, my eyes replace the eyes
that death has taken.
i can see out or through.
it is not a bad fate
to be a cow,
to be, at once,
so awkward,
so full of grace,
so full of milk. everywhere the udders are full,
the teats are ready,
the mouth of the calf is soft and deep.
i would thrust my hand in it
for the wet joy of being so used.my own breasts are marked
from the time the milk came in too fast; i did not have time to grow
to the moment of giving.
it is fitting
that beauty
leaves such scars. milk has passed through my fingers,
has spurted through my fingers,
but not once
during these seven lean years.

this is the silence around the poem of the death of my father.
this is the silence before the poem. while my father was dying, the challenger was exploding on tv
again and again. i watched it happen. in his hospital room,
i followed his breath. then it stopped. this is the silence in a poem about the dying of the father. we’re burning the earth. we’re burning the sky. here is another silence in the middle of the poem about the immolation of the fathers. the pyres of bodies in saigon.
the burned air
the charred limbs.
ash.
rancid flames.
heat
light
fire we turn away. here is another silence within the poem about the burial of the fire. when my father died, the rains poured down the moment i picked up the shovel of earth.
i staggered under the weight of the water. another silence please. i have always wanted to be a woman of fire.
i will have to learn how to rain.
gently, i will learn how to rain. i have set fire to your green fields,
may i be water to your burning lands. please join me in this last silence at the end of the poem of fire.

everything dies. without you
i saw one million flamingos ignite a lake in africa.
the same darkness descended everywhere.
when you dropped your body, i hoped you would tremble
for the beak of god. why did we wash you three times
tearing off the girl’s white dress to swaddle you in an austere shroud?
some say, dying, not death, teaches. you gained nothing
from that reduction. months in the narrow foxhole of disease–
you dug it; we filled it in.my father is thin as you were
in his hospital bed, both of you let everything go,
care for nothing except that barbed hook–
life.it grabbed you like a thorn
until you begged me, “pull it out.”

i wanted to have a poem and i was pregnant. i was very thin. as if i’d lived on air. a poet must be able to live on air, but a mother must not attempt it. my mother wanted me to buy a set of matching pots, wearever aluminum, like the ones she had. they were heavy and had well fitting lids so my suppers wouldn’t burn. my husband wanted me to give dinner parties. john f. kennedy was running for office.i sensed danger. kennedy wasn’t against the bomb or for nuclear disarmament. i joined sane at its inception. also concerned scientists. i spoke with linus pauling and encouraged my husband to help his partner organize physicians for social responsibility. there was a baby in my belly. i wanted to write poems. i had a crazy idea that a woman could write a real novel, the kind that shook the world. i hallucinated that a woman could be a poet, but she would have to be free. i couldn’t imagine that freedom for myself even though i could see it in isla negra when i followed pablo neruda. i could see it in the way he walked. even if he were walking inside a dictatorship, among guns, soldiers and spies, there was nothing between him and his vision. anything he saw, he was able to take into himself–there was no sight, no image, no vision to which he didn’t feel entitled. in his heart, everything–everything–belonged to him. pablo neruda was–more than anything–a poet, and so he was an entitled man. i was a woman and entitled to nothing. i had nothing except a husband, a rented house, a set of pots, living room furniture, a frenzy of obligations, credit cards, anxious relatives, too many acquaintances, a gift of future diaper service, two telephones, no time to read, a plastic wrapped cookbook of recipes gleaned from the pages of the new york times, and a hunger, a terrible hunger for the unimaginable, unlimited freedom of being a poet, and a baby in my belly. i would have called pablo long distance if i had the courage, if i had the ability to speak spanish fluently, if we had ever talked about real things. but, what would a man know about a baby in the belly? and what did it matter if there were to be one poet more or less in the world when so many in his country were dying? i woke up one morning and thought–i can’t have this child. my husband said, “you’ll have to get a job after it’s born so we can buy a house. you’ll need an advanced degree so you can do something.” i thought, i can’t. i have to write poems. my mother found a crib. someone painted it white. a friend sent a pastel mobile with tame wood animals. i thought about blue curtains, making bedspreads, and abortions. pablo was silent. he was walking so far from me, i couldn’t hear him. my husband objected to donating more free medical care to the black panthers. i tried to make dolmades from scratch and located grape leaves preserved in brine at the boys’ market twenty miles away. i organized a write-in campaign for peace to challenge jfk. my husband thought it would be nice to have teatime with the children and romantic dinners by ourselves. the new formula bottles lined up on the sink like tiny bombs. the u.s. was pursuing over ground testing; i was afraid the radiation would cross the milk barrier. i had a poem in me howling for real life but no language to write in. the fog came in thick, flapping about my feet like blankets unraveling. i became afraid to have a daughter. i called pablo neruda in the middle of the night as he walked underwater by isla negra. he moved like a dream porpoise. he seemed pregnant with words. they came out of his penis in long miraculous strings. the sea creatures quivered with joy. i said, “pablo, i want to know how to bear the child in my belly onto this bed of uranium and i want to know if a woman can a be a poet.” he was large as a whale. he drank the sea and spouted it in glistening odes, black and shiny. i said, “i can’t have this child,” and he laughed as if he had never done anything but carry and birth children.so i packed my little bag as if i were going to the hospital and i left a note and the wearever pots and sterilized nipples upon the glass missiles, and took the cradle board than an american indian friend had given me for the baby and that had made my husband snort– “you’re not going to carry the thing on your back, are you?” i took some money, the car, some books, paper and pens, my walking shoes, an unwieldly ibm electric typewriter, my pregnant belly and a dozen cloth diapers, and i went out. i knew how to carry a baby and how to carry a poem and i would learn how to have a baby and even how to have a poem. i would have enough milk for both. i would learn how to walk with them. but i didn’t know, and i didn’t want to know, how to have a husband and a matched set of wearever pots.

terrible. every small want, every niggling urge,

passed. when at last we knew how little 
would survive us—how little we had mended or built that was not now lost—something

what a profound longing
i feel, just this very instant,
for the garden of eden
on montague street
where i seldom shopped,
usually only after therapy
elbow sore at the crook
from a handbasket filled
to capacity. the glossy pastries!
pomegranate, persimmon, quince!
once, a bag of black beluga
lentils spilt a trail behind me
while i labored to find
a tea they refused to carry.
it was brooklyn. my thirties.
everyone i knew was living
the same desolate luxury,
each ashamed of the same things:
innocence and privacy. i'd lug
home the paper bags, doing
bank-balance math and counting days.
i'd squint into it, or close my eyes
and let it slam me in the face—
the known sun setting
on the dawning century.

i love you, she said. she didn't
know me, but i believed her,
and a terrible new ache
rolled over in my chest,
like in a room where the drapes
have been swept back. i love you,
i love you, as she continued
down the hall past other strangers,
each feeling pierced suddenly
by pillars of heavy light.
i love you, throughout
the performance, in every
handclap, every stomp.
i love you in the rusted iron
chains someone was made
to drag until love let them be
unclasped and left empty
in the center of the ring.
i love you in the water
where they pretended to wade,
singing that old blood-deep song
that dragged us to those banks
and cast us in. i love you,
the angles of it scraping at
each throat, shouldering past
the swirling dust motes
in those beams of light
that whatever we now knew
we could let ourselves feel, knew
to climb. o woods—o dogs—
o tree—o gun—o girl, run—
o miraculous many gone—
o lord—o lord—o lord—
is this love the trouble you promised?

blizzard of waves let loose in the kitchen,
and she'd need to make her escape. no,
she'd trust no one but herself, her own
new lean always jittering legs to carry her—
where exactly? where would a child go?
to there. there alone. she'd rest one elbow
on the table—the opposite one to the bent leg
skimming the solid expensive tasteful chair.
and even though we were together, her eyes
would go half-dome, shades dropped
like a screen at some cinema the old aren't
let into. i thought i'd have more time! i thought
my body would have taken longer going
about the inevitable feat of repelling her,
but now, i could see even in what food
she left untouched, food i'd bought and made
and all but ferried to her lips, i could see
how it smacked of all that had grown slack
and loose in me. her other arm
would wave the fork around just above
the surface of the plate, casting about
for the least possible morsel, the tiniest
grain of unseasoned rice. she'd dip
into the food like one of those shoddy
metal claws poised over a valley of rubber
bouncing balls, the kind that lifts nothing
or next to nothing and drops it in the chute.
the narrow untouched hips. the shoulders
still so naïve as to stand squared, erect,
impervious facing the window open
onto the darkening dusk.

if you don't get too close to people you can't disappoint them,
which would be so much worse
than letting them disappoint you.to the extent that you gain
a perch that means other people look up to you,
to just that extent you can never
tell them how you feel. you can warble, or
follow a siren, or a shenandoah
vireo, into the shade, or take
advice from the lights: be
a child, or be like a child.
you will want for nothing, and you will never be heard.

i can remember when i wanted x
more than anything ever—for x fill in
from your own childhood[balloon, pencil lead, trading card, shoelaces, a bow
or not to have to wear a bow]and now i am moved to action, when i am moved,
principally by a memory of what to want. the point is to be, in your own eyes, what you are, or to keep your own tools, so that you can pretend. and so it was no surprise,
to me at least, when cooper, who is two,
collapsed in fortissimo fits when he could not have
a $20, three-foot-long stuffed frog
in the image of frog from frog and toad, since he is toad. that morning, needing a nap,
he had thrown, from the third-story balcony
of miller's cafe and bakery, into the whistling
rapids and shallows
of the ammonoosuc river, with its arrowheads and caravans of stones,
his red sox cap. his hair was shining like
another planet's second sun,
as he explained, looking up, "i threw my hat in the river.
i would like my hat back now."

i didn’t mail myself like a letter some other kids
already knew. i learned to use stamps. they stuck to my thumb
without any glue. i didn’t have any permission.
there was a snowstorm that lasted three days
and a cavern of monochrome memory. there were board games, and a
pencil-and-paper game
where the object was to figure out the object of the game.
there was a stack of broad-rule writing paper, and a stapled calendar,
and a 64-pack of sparkly rainbow crayons, to make each week look different
since they all started out black and white, and all the same.
o grapefruit (as color and flavor). o never quite rightly tied laces. o look,
up there on the uneven climbing bars,
too hot to touch where the sun touches, now that it’s spring, the shadow of a tarp, like a sail between sailors
and thin swings that make no decision, like weathervanes. o think of the lost chuck taylors. the lost mary janes.

the inside out mermaid is fine with letting it all hang out–veins, muscles, the bits of fat at her belly, her small gray spleen. at first her lover loves it–with her organs on the outside, she's the ultimate open book. he can pump her lungs like two bellows and make her gasp; ask her difficult questions and study the synapses firing in her brain as she answers to see if she's lying; poke a pleasure center in the frontal lobe and watch her squirm. no need for bouquets or sad stories about his childhood. he just plucks a pulmonary vein and watches the left ventricle flounder. but before long, she starts to sense that her lover, like all the others before him, is getting restless. this is when she starts showing them her collections–the basket of keys from all over the world, the box of zippers with teeth of every imaginable size–all chosen to convey a sense of openness. as a last resort, she’ll even read out loud the entries from her diary about him to him. but eventually he’ll become convinced she’s hiding things from him and she is. her perfect skin. her long black hair. her red mouth, never chapped from exposure to sun or wind, how she secretly loves that he can’t touch her here or here.

when my hole-punch drizzles tiny paper circles onto the carpet, my wolf sister moans and bites it, covering her ears with her paws. i think she’s tired of the moon. she takes a stack of dinner plates from my cupboard and slinks off to the park to break them. our brother shows up a week later, collapses on the sofa like a fur throw. why have they come here when everything i do is wrong? they howl in the shower together but the water doesn’t mask the sound. i go in afterwards with paper towels to mop the droplets–i know there’ll be water all over–but the room is bone dry. maybe this time things will be different. i hide the home movies in case they ask for them. in the one i always watch, there’s some wobbly footage of the sky, then my father lowers the camera’s eye to mother teaching my sister and brother to “tell time.” they’re following a mother hare on her sunset rounds–one leveret mouthful at 12 o’clock, another at 3, 6, 9. then the camera zooms in on me–i’ve spat out my pacifier made of fur and i’m on the porch surrounded by bonsai trees, killing or saving barbie.

sunday, awake with this headache. i pull apart the evening with a fork. white
clot behind the eyes. someone once told me, before and after is just another false binary. the
warmed-over bones of january. i had no passport. beneath the stove, two mice
made a paradise out of a button of peanut butter. suffering operates by its own logic. its gropings and reversals. ample, in ways
that are exquisite. and how it leaves—not unlike how it arrives, without clear
notice. these days, i've had my fill of chinatown and its wet markets. gutted fish.
overcooked chattering. the stench making me look hard at everything. summer mornings before the heat has moved in. joy has been buried in me
overnight, but builds in the early hours. my attention elastic. the babbling streets of causeway bay, out of which the sharp taste of the city
emerges. nothing can stay dry here. the dark cherries of eyes come and go,
as they please. let there be no more braiding of words. i want a spare mouth.my father taught me wherever you are, always be looking for a way out: this
opening or that one. or a question. sharp enough to slice a hole for you to slip
through. long car trips where i sat in the back of our family's used nissan. the stale
odor of plush seats and sun-warmed cola. my parents' and my words do not
touch. i grow adept at tunneling inward, a habit i have yet to let go of. i am protective of what eyes cannot pry open. the unannounced. the infinite
places within language to hide.
a zen priest once told me that without snagging on a storyline, the body can
only take loss for ninety seconds. the physical body has its limits, is what i
heard. the imagination can break through them. boiled peanuts. leather of daybreak. cotton thinning out into thread. dried
vomit. ice water from the spigot. the sacred and profane share a border. in the
desert, small droppings of unknown origin. even when i was young, i loved peering at faces in films. the pleasure of
watching and of not being watched. black koi fish open their mouths at the skin of the pond for oxygen. at the edge
of the water, i hold two lines from ikkyū in my mouth. make my way slowly. nights when i shared a bed in a small room. another’s body to the left, hooked
by a heavy dream. funny, the way we come to understand a place by wanting to escape it. i can shake out the imprint of my body on the sheets each morning. but the
mind–the mind is a different matter. when i was four, i ate spoonfuls of powdered milk straight from the canister. the powder was sweet. there wasn't enough money for fresh milk. seven
hundred years ago, chang yang-hao wrote, all my life seems / like yesterday morning.

the face of chinatown returns its color,
plucked from july's industrial steamer.
dry the cup!
so we do. four noodle shops on east broadway release their belches collectively.
they breed in me a hankering for family life. here, there's no logic to melons and spring onions exchanging hands.
no rhythm to men's briefs clothes-pinned to the fire escape. retirees beneath the manhattan bridge leak hearsay. the woman in apartment #18 on bayard washes her feet in pot of boiled
water each evening before bedtime. but every handful of weeks she lapses. i lean into the throat of summer. perched above these streets with whom i share verbs and adjectives. faces knotted, bangs softened with grease.
the east river pulls along a thread of sun. while sunday slides in. again, in those plain trousers. how the heat is driven off course.
how one can make out the clarified vowels of bridges. who’s keeping count of what’s given against what’s stolen? there's nothing i can't trace back to my coarse immigrant blood. uncles tipple wine on the streets of mott and bayard.
night shifts meet day shifts in passing. sweat seasons the body that labors. and in each noodle shop, bowls dusted with salt.

crows feed on sand.so poor is this season
the ground steals color
from the tree-shadows. can it be that nothing

don't forget to pick
off this self and that self
along the way. though that’s not right–
you spit them out like pits. if there is a partition between
the outer and inner worlds,
how is it that some water in me churns
between the mountain ranges? how is it we are absorbed so easily
by the ground—long nights for simple words. slant rhyme of current thinking
and past thinking. a chewed over hour, late.
where the long ago past
and the future come
to settle scores. traveling and traveling,
but so much interior
unpicked over by the eyes. nothing is as far as here.

i’m not yet comfortable with the word,
its short clean woosh that sounds like
life. at dinner last night my single girls
said in admonition, “it’s not wife-approved”
about a friend’s upcoming trip. their
eyes rolled up and over and out their
pretty young heads. wife, why does it
sound like a job? “i need a wife” the famous
feminist wrote, “a wife that will keep my
clothes clean, ironed, mended, replaced
if need be.” a word that could be made
easily into maid. a wife that does, fixes
soothes, honors, obeys, housewife,
fishwife, bad wife, good wife, what’s
the word for someone who stares long
into the morning, unable to even fix tea
some days, the kettle steaming over
loud like a train whistle, she who cries
in the mornings, she who tears a hole
in the earth and cannot stop grieving,
the one who wants to love you, but often
isn’t good at even that, the one who
doesn’t want to be diminished
by how much she wants to be yours.

i can’t undress from the pressure of leaves,
the lobed edges leaning toward the window
like an unwanted male gaze on the backside,
(they wish to bless and bless and hush).
what if i want to go devil instead? bow
down to the madness that makes me. drone
of the neighbor’s mowing, a red mailbox flag
erected, a dog bark from three houses over,
and this is what a day is. beetle on the wainscoting,
dead branch breaking, but not breaking, stones
from the sea next to stones from the river,
unanswered messages like ghosts in the throat,
a siren whining high toward town repeating
that the emergency is not here, repeating
that this loud silence is only where you live.

after the birthing of bombs of forks and fear
the frantic automatic weapons unleashed,
the spray of bullets into a crowd holding hands,
that brute sky opening in a slate metal maw
that swallows only the unsayable in each of us, what’s
left? even the hidden nowhere river is poisoned
orange and acidic by a coal mine. how can
you not fear humanity, want to lick the creek
bottom dry, to suck the deadly water up into
your own lungs, like venom? reader, i want to
say: don’t die. even when silvery fish after fish
comes back belly up, and the country plummets
into a crepitating crater of hatred, isn’t there still
something singing? the truth is: i don’t know.
but sometimes, i swear i hear it, the wound closing
like a rusted-over garage door, and i can still move
my living limbs into the world without too much
pain, can still marvel at how the dog runs straight
toward the pickup trucks break-necking down
the road, because she thinks she loves them,
because she’s sure, without a doubt, that the loud
roaring things will love her back, her soft small self
alive with desire to share her goddamn enthusiasm,
until i yank the leash back to save her because
i want her to survive forever. don’t die, i say,
and we decide to walk for a bit longer, starlings
high and fevered above us, winter coming to lay
her cold corpse down upon this little plot of earth.
perhaps we are always hurtling our body towards
the thing that will obliterate us, begging for love
from the speeding passage of time, and so maybe,
like the dog obedient at my heels, we can walk together
peacefully, at least until the next truck comes.

the truth is, i’ve never cared for the national
anthem. if you think about it, it’s not a good
song. too high for most of us with “the rockets
red glare” and then there are the bombs.
(always, always, there is war and bombs.)
once, i sang it at homecoming and threw
even the tenacious high school band off key.
but the song didn’t mean anything, just a call
to the field, something to get through before
the pummeling of youth. and what of the stanzas
we never sing, the third that mentions “no refuge
could save the hireling and the slave”? perhaps,
the truth is, every song of this country
has an unsung third stanza, something brutal
snaking underneath us as we blindly sing
the high notes with a beer sloshing in the stands
hoping our team wins. don’t get me wrong, i do
like the flag, how it undulates in the wind
like water, elemental, and best when it’s humbled,
brought to its knees, clung to by someone who
has lost everything, when it’s not a weapon,
when it flickers, when it folds up so perfectly
you can keep it until it’s needed, until you can
love it again, until the song in your mouth feels
like sustenance, a song where the notes are sung
by even the ageless woods, the short-grass plains,
the red river gorge, the fistful of land left
unpoisoned, that song that’s our birthright,
that’s sung in silence when it’s too hard to go on,
that sounds like someone’s rough fingers weaving
into another’s, that sounds like a match being lit
in an endless cave, the song that says my bones
are your bones, and your bones are my bones,
and isn’t that enough?

there is a river under this poem.
it flows blue and icy
and carries these lines down the page.
somewhere beneath its surface
lying chained to the silt
harry holds his breath
and slowly files
his fingernails into moons.
he wonders who still waits at the dock
if the breasts of those young girls
have developed since he sank.
he thinks of his parents
of listening to the tumblers
of his mother's womb
of escaping upward out of puberty
out of the pupils in his father's eyes
and those hot wisconsin fields.
he dreams of escaping
from this poem
of cracking the combinations
to his own body
and those warm young safes
of every girl on the dock.
jiggling his chains
harry scares a carp that circles
and nibbles at his feet.
he feels the blue rush of the current
sweeping across his body
stripping his chains of their rust
until each link softens
and glows like a tiny eel.
and harry decides to ascend.
he slips with the water
through his chains
and climbing over and over
his own air bubbles
he waves to the fish
to his chains glittering
and squirming in the silt.
he pauses to pick a bouquet
of seaweed for the young girls
on the dock. rising
he bursts the surface of this poem.
he listens for shouts.
he hears only the night
and a buoy sloshing in the blue.

my body oiled for warmth,
black rubber cap on my head,
eyes hidden behind goggles,
i was exhausted, ready to drown,
when i saw her coming toward me,
bobbing up and down between waves,
effortlessly doing a breaststroke,
headed for dover. treading water,
i asked in french if she spoke english,
and she said, “yes, i’m an american.”
i said, “hey, me too,” then asked her out for coffee.

what i envy in the open eyes
of the dead deer hanging down
from the rafters, its eyes

staring at the moment when
it died. the blue light
falling through the window
into this smoke-filled room
is the same color as the mist
coming down off the mountain
that morning: the deer sees
men with guns
but also sees, beyond them,
the endless mountains.

valentine’s day breakfast at baker’s square:
laura drinks coffee while i watch andrew,
who refuses to sit but chooses instead
to stay in the restaurant’s vestibule where
he opens and closes the big double doors
over and over again, as if he’s practicing
a grand entrance–entering, crossing

close behind him. i’m thinking, it wasn’t so long ago i carried my tiny son
piggyback through the woods to a waterfall;
wasn’t long ago i kissed laura for the first time;
wasn’t long ago i lived in the house with my dog

sipping burnt coffee and scratching out lines,
lighting my hundredth cigarette, starting over

will the children forgive the generation
that’s trampled by horses of war,
by exile and preparation for departure? will they think of us as we were,
a bunch of ambushes in ravines
we’d shake our jealousy
and carve trees into the earth's shirt
to sit under,
we, the factional fighters
who’d shoo the clouds of war out of their vehicles
and peer around our eternal siege
or catch the dead
like sudden fruit fallen on a wasteland? will the children forgive what we were,
some missile shepherds
and masters of exile and frenzied celebration,
whenever a neighboring war gestured to us
we rose
to set up in its braids a place
good for love and residence? the bombing rarely took a rest
the missile launchers rarely returned unharmed
we rarely picked flowers for the dead or went on
with our lives if only that summer had given us a bit
of time's space before our mad departure will they believe?

will come to carry us down to the streets

his white stumbling and the illusion that plucks words a shout that walks on two feeble legs
eyes me with the summer of discontent
and sprinkles me with water, turns me green
before it shakes the bitter dirt
off its fingers
… that's my father

near the camp was a river
and in our house were absentees and hands
that will one day wake us in vaini had just turned seven
while he was sitting in the shade
ironing his clothes
the blue jacket sagging over his shoulders i paid no attention to the road
or the three steps
and didn't notice the carpet i don't remember who was it that said
to me or to another
"when you grow up poetry will become your house" the dust that eats the memories
always distances those folks yet their chairs appear from afar,
from behind the hills and over the houses,
to hang in an air of summer and holm oak,
those shaded chairs that reach the heart
on shoulders topped
with five flowers which flowers are speech
which flowers are silence? and i can't remember
whether it was my uncle who stood at the door,
whether we had palm and lotus trees
in our house in karameh, whether my mother
who gave birth to me on the shelf
was folding our clothes behind our father's back
so he could sleep the watchdogs used to cry from the heat,
and poetry, husseini of jerusalem,
and khidr the mystic were all in our house
as was my uncle who came from a pond
within hebron's walls twenty years would pass before a photo could tell us
we have grown older
and that's that my father used to discompose his friends
with his days, and women
with the thread of seduction in his voice
as he would sprinkle chatter in their rivers
while walking about here or there with a lilt,
he'd let his days fall off him
and let others gather them as he walked
on gold that came only for him and i can't remember:
in our courtyard there were holm oaks,
a fountain, a tiled floor by a huge door,
we were confused and in a hurr ythe closet that faced us in the second room
had a mirror
the mirror we now seek and my father was standing alone in the hall that led
the stairs to the roof
thanking his days
or preparing for wednesday's nap
or thursday's morning
as he left, among the things he'd leave, the water can
full of water
while around his chairs our saturdays rose my father didn't want too much from life:
a house, five boys
who don't mess with his papers,
which were already chaos,
and two girls
so that braids could float all around the house

when i was young, exorcisms were quite common, a remedy not unlike
ice baths. plus, devils were shorter in those days just as people were.
they hadn't eaten enough fruits or vegetables, and lacked essential
vitamins and iron, grew thin and pale, fell easily into brooding
depressions. they looked more like deer than sheep, and when they
possessed you it was usually because they were fleeing from someone
else and didn't realize where they were until it was too late. it was more
a question of giving directions than driving them out. "turn right at the
hairdresser's, go straight until you get to the abandoned schoolhouse,
then turn left. you should see the exit from there." "thank you. i was
completely lost." "you're welcome. good luck." "you too, and thanks
again."

there is a hole.
in the hole is everything
people will do
to each other. the hole goes down and down.
it has many rooms
like graves and like graves
they are all connected. roots hang from the dirt
in craggy chandeliers.
it's not clear
where the hole stops beginning and where
it starts to end.
it's warm and dark down there.
the passages multiply. there are ballrooms.
there are dead ends.
the air smells of iron and
crushed flowers. people will do anything.
they will cut the hands off children.
children will do anything—in the hole is everything.

it is easy to love a pig in a nightgown.
see how he sleeps, white flannel
straining his neck at the neckhole.
his body swells and then deflates.
the gown is nothing to be ashamed of, only
the white clay of moonlight smeared
over his hulk, original clothing, the milk
of his loneliness. the flickering candle
of a dream moves his warty eyelids.
all sleeping things are children.

a house
with three stories.
in the basement, monsters.
the upper floors were empty.
no furniture, nothing.
i had a magic pebble
that i needed to hide.
but where?
woke in a room
with the bed breathing.
each day the same
scandal—this body.
these teeth and hands. the miniature bed
a miniature bed, and in it two tiny people
not sleeping, not able to sleep because
a small lie has flowered between them,
fragile as a new, white crocus.
the miniature bed holds them like a miniature boat
making its slow, true course to morning.
these tiny people, thoughts thrumming like mice,
are quiet as the lie blooms over them
in the night, fanning its moth petals,
becoming to them like a moon hovering
over their bed, a moon they might almost touch
with their miniature hands, if they weren't certain
that one wrong gesture might break
the spindles of their small world, if their hearts
were not drops of trembling quicksilver,
if they were brave, if they could see
that small is no smaller than big, that thimbles
are deep as oceans for any god, they might even
touch each other then, opening the dark,
like a match, the sun's flaring. harvest the fields are a book of uses.
near the house
a combine takes the corn down
in long rows.
dust rises up and replaces itself.
a quick net of starlings
drops to the furrows
and sunshine pours like polished grain
onto the feeding earth,
this country.in the kitchen, milk streams
from the gallon
thin and fresh as luck.
we flourish.
all around us, things flourish.
cows strain the fence with their abundance.
the herd makes a sound like swelling. out in the cut field
birds clean the fallen cobs
into sets of teeth. sonnet for lost teeth the combines were tearing off the field’s clothes.
it was august, haying season. my tooth
was loose, a snag in the clam of my mouth.
i worked it like a pearl. i'd been out of school
for sixty days. in the sweat of the barn
i watched him shoot the calf in the head.
he wiped the hide gently, like cleaning his glasses.
overnight, i grew a beard so i wouldn't
have to get married. i let my feet go black
from burned grasses. it never gets easier
he said, kicking straw over the blood patch.
she went down so quiet it was almost
sad. later, when my tooth fell out, i buried it
under my pillow and it grew into money. talisman waiting for the school bus you find
the femur of a baby animal
on the ground. you carry
that femur in your pocket
the entire morning and touch it
secretly through the cloth.
when the teacher asks
a question you don't raise
your hand but quietly
wrap your fingers around
the thin shape, that bone
without a mother. on waking half of everything is invisible.
a river drifts below the river.
a gesture lost in the body.
wind moves through the open
windows of the trees. beyond the day, another day. dreamed i was drowning
my mother's silk laundry
in the river,
kneeling on the wet rocks.
back and forth i drowned it
in the gray clouds... eros each year fish run the green vein of the river.
the bones of skunks lie buried in the riverbank
upside down, waiting for rain. from a fragment of a greek statue
you can tell the posture of the whole god.
a skeleton has the same intelligence.so that when a girl discovers it,
loosened by summer rain, surfaced
like a white instrument in the grass,
she suddenly knows how to take it up
and shake the strange rhythms from it like castanets. a childhood the horse had been beaten and flies
crawled excited on the beat marks.
he held still in the sunblazed pasture.
for a few minutes i stood at the wire fence.
he was aware of me, but he did not turn—
except his eye, slightly. he listened
through the many ears of the grasses.
a jay made a hole in the air with its cry.
everywhere, invisible as heat, the gods
married each other and went to war.
the excitement of it vibrated in the flies.
as if we both were standing still
inside some greater, more violent motion.

what is so pure as grief? a wreck
set sail just to be wrecked again.
to lose what’s lost–it’s all born lost
and we just fetch it for a little while,
a dandelion span, a quarter-note.
each day an envelope gummed shut
with honey and mud. foolish
to think you can build a house
from suffering. even the hinges will be
bitter. there will be no books
in that house, only transfusions.
and all the lemon and cedar
in the world won't rid the walls
of that hospital smell.

it’s all the rage to sport waxed moustaches
and cure your own sausages
in some mildewy basement that formerly
would have hosted convulsively
awkward parties with spin the bottle and seven
minutes in the dark and terrifying closet
(aka heaven) but now boasts soppressata
strung on repurposed vintage drying racks
and fat clay pots of kombucha and curdling hops.
personally i've never recovered from the sex-shaped
void left in those closets by all the groping
that should have occurred to me but didn't:
right under my nose kids my age were creeping
into adulthood one clammy, trembling palm
on one breast at a time. there was also
the horror of not being chosen in gym.
it is conceivable that learning intricately
how to butcher an entire hog
and render every morsel might give one
a feeling of mastery one lacked in childhood.it is the greatest immaturity to believe suffering entitles you to something someone wiser
and grayer than i once said.
but in those basements and carpools and
playgrounds as i assassinated one by one
clandestinely my torturers
abandoning their foul normal
bodies to compost the astonishing
tedium of the wending suburban lanes,
i was transubstantiating to supernal
fame and beauty and such eerie genius
that entire books were written about my
books. in fact it takes a long time to realize
your suffering is of very little consequence
to anyone but you. and by that time the future
is already happening and you're pickling okra
and starfruit and foraging for morels in urban forests
and suspending artisan mozzarella in little wet nets
and crafting small-batch, nitrite-free data
and maybe even thinking about having
children, which you swore in a million
billion years you would never do.

i want to write my lover a poem
but a very bad one. it'll include
a giant squid and some loose change and cuff links and two blue ferries chugging
headfirst on the east river at twenty-six knots
and only at the last minute averting disaster through quick thinking and sure reflexes. also
a bow and arrow and glossy red apple
i perch in front of my heart. to be honest my lover doesn't really like poetry,
which i guess is why i plan to write
such a bad one, so he can feel right and strong and good in his beliefs.
tonight when i go see my lover
he’ll hold me as i've never been held except by him and then i'll have to give him
back. when you get new things
you treat them like glass for a while and then get used to them
and manhandle them
like everything else. i don't want to give him back
but partly it's not up to me and
partly i don't want to be his old sofa. i want to radiate and gleam
arrestingly until the certain, premature
end. you can compose a whole life out of these rollercoasters.
you can be everywhere
and nowhere, over and over
life slapping you in the face
till you’re newly burnished
flat-out gasping and awake.

after three weeks of hot weather and drought,
we've had a week of cold and rain,
just the way it ought to be here in the north,
in june, a fire going in the woodstove
all day long, so you can go outside in the cold
and rain anytime and smell
the wood smoke in the air. this is the way i love it. this is why
i came here almost

i can feel myself slipping away, fading away, withdrawing
from this life, just as my father did. when the pain you're in is so great you can’t think about or pay attention to anything
but your own pain, the rest of the world and all other life don't matter. i think about my friends with dementia, cancer, arthritis, and
how much more pain they are in than i am, but it does no good, their pain is not mine, and therefore, no matter how magnanimous
i might want to be, their pain is not as important to me as my own.

when i came to this mountainside almost fifty years ago it never occurred to me that there would be an end to it. i went along never thinking about the time when i would have to quit. i imagined—i guess — all this would last forever, if i imagined it at all. now i'm in my seventies and all i can think about is the time when my life will be here no more.
for example, i love being in the woods felling and bucking hardwood trees, stacking and covering the blocks, then a year or two later, hauling them to the woodshed where i stack them again, and split them all winter long into the right size for the weather—then bring them into the house. now this chore i love so much is seriously painful, and i can see, now, an end to it.

the eye’s desire for relief.
i’m the tiger lily bobbing in the heat.
and also the neighbor, shaved bald and
lifting weights on the balcony. each petal
is the receipt of a shameful dream—
a thought we hadn’t wanted to incorporate
lolling from my parted mouth.
but you know it’s mistakes that make life happen.
a cardboard suitcase of beer for the traveler.
and if we get too close to the words
on this page they soften and warp
into an animal lace, some net
whose logic won’t reveal itself. i pull our eyes
back because i love you. but then you draw them
back further still because that sounds like an excuse.
the whiny version of love hurts loops and curls
like ribbon through a scissor, being pulled
across the blade. the money in this poem’s
easy, if you don’t mind having no thoughts and
sitting in one place, while your body changes shape.

to shrimp estuaries, bird rookeries, oyster bays,
to tube worms & sea turtles. to watercolor these pelican grasses,
oxidized, unapologetic executive marshes, roseated spoonbills. for you who longed to smear concentric circles,
to have trusted you with longitude and latitude,
to blur this sargassum border between mourning,
fighting, and willful denying of objects and subjects. as if generations of fishermen, scaling orders of magnitude,
navigated oily streaks of miles in a legend of inches,
skeletal, ghostly swarms of now-opaque, milky jellyfish. as if

everyone wants to write about god
but no one wants to imagine their god as the finger trembling inside a grenade
pin’s ring or the red vine of blood coughed into a child’s palm while they cradle the head of a dying parent.
few things are more dangerous than a man who is capable of dividing himself into several men,
each of them with a unique river of desire on their tongues. it is also magic to pray for a daughter
and find yourself with an endless march of boys who all have the smile of a motherfucker who wronged you
and never apologized. no one wants to imagine their god as the knuckles cracking on a father watching their son
picking a good switch from the tree and certainly no one wants to imagine their god as the tree.
enough with the foolishness of hope and how it bruises the walls of a home where two people sit, stubbornly in love
with the idea of staying. if one must pray, i imagine it is most worthwhile to pray towards endings.
the only difference between sunsets and funerals is whether or not a town mistakes the howls
of a crying woman for madness.

i moved to this place,
iowa city
where green-headed mallards
walk the streets day and night,
and defecate on sidewalks.
greasy meat bags in wetsuits,
disguise themselves as pets
and are free as birds.
maybe indians should have thought of that?
maybe you would have
left us alone,
if we put on rubber bills,
and rubber feet,
quacked instead of complained,
swam instead of danced
waddled away when you did
what you did…
i moved to the place
the “jewel of the midwest”
where ghosts of ourselves
dance the sulphur trails. fumes emerge continuous
from the mouths of
three-faced deities who preach,
“we absolve joy through suffering.”
i moved to this place where
in 1992, up washed columbus again
like a pointy-chinned son of cannibals.
his spin doctors rewrite his successes
“after 500 years and 25 million dead,
one out of 100 american indians commit suicide
one out of 10 american indians are alcoholics
49 years is the average lifespan of american indians.” each minute burns
the useful and useless alike
sing hallelujah
praise the lord
when you foreigners
build your off-world colonies
and relocate in outer space
this is what we will do
we will dance,
we will dance,
we will dance
to a duck’s tune.

shriek into bloom above the tilt-a-whirls,
hang for a blink, then die in smoky swirls.
they scream revolt at what the body knows:
all revels end. we clap and sigh. then, no—
another rose! another peony! break,
flame, roar, as though by roaring they might make
the rides whirl in perpetuum. as though
we need not finally, wearily turn, to plow
back through the crush of bodies, the lank air,
to buses that inch us, sweating, across town.
as though we were not dropped in silence there
to trudge the last blocks home, the streetlamps low,
the crickets counting summer's seconds down.

stood in the farmhouse mud room
while he sat in the kitchen,
unshaven, dealing solitaire. his wife (we called her auntie)
rolled out dough in the kitchen
for a pie, put up preserves
and tidied, clearing her throat. they listened to the tv
at six, he with his fingers
fumbling the hearing aids,
she watching the kitchen clock. old age went on like that,
a vegetable patch, a horse

stood muddy in the mud room

some days her main job seems to be
to welcome back the red admiral
as it lights on a leaf of the yellow
forsythia. it is her duty to stop & lean
over to take in how it folds & opens
its wings. then, too, there is the common
tiger swallowtail, which seems to her
entirely uncommon in how it moves
about the boundaries of this clearing
we made so many years ago. if she leaves
the compost bucket unwashed to rescue
a single tattered wing from under the winter
jasmine or the blue flowers of the periwinkle
& then spends a whole afternoon at our round
oak table surrounded by field guides
& tea until she is sure—yes—that it belongs to
a lorquin's admiral, or that singular
mark is one of the great cat's eyes
of a milbert's tortoiseshell, then she is
simply practicing her true vocation
learning the story behind the blue beads
of the mourning cloak, the silver commas
of the satyr anglewing, the complex shades
of the spring azure, moving through this life
letting her sweet, light attention land
on one luminous thing after another.

you lost your name in the nameless void. “o mary don’t you weep don’t you moan” 
o mary shake your butt to the violent juke,
absorb the demon puke and watch the white eyes pop,

and dance like an angel on the point of a needle.

and lift his weight from you black belly,
so i grab the air and sing my song.

and we are but grapes aching with ripeness.
crush us!
squeeze from us all the brave life
contained in these full skins.
but ours is a subtle strength
potent with centuries of yearning,
of being kegged and shut away
in dark forgotten places. we shall endure
to steal your senses
in that lonely twilight
of your winter’s grief.

we are spendthrifts with words,
we squander them,
toss them like pennies in the air–
arrogant words,
angry words,
cruel words,
comradely words,
shy words tiptoeing from mouth to ear. but the slowly wrought words of love
and the thunderous words of heartbreak–
those we hoard.

that field nag, old-penny
swayback. low hawk, to
ducks in train to a quad of geese,
in case. last night, the long moon lay it seemed a tissue
of snow, but then dawn told
that wasn't so. late morning, now,
the fire, the hearth, eggs sitting for the mute plate
and fork, this pen making
a thing of them. two more nights—
waterfowl safe and noisy in the dusk, the low rails
running flank to the river
at midnight—find what they'll
make of that river, this moon.

most have been plowed up or paved over
but you can still find them, tracks cut
deep into the earth by prairie schooners
crossing that great green ocean, pitching
waves of pasture out where there's nothing
else to do but live. concealing their detritus—
a piece of sun-bleached buffalo skull, a button
from a cavalry soldier's coat—the ruts wind
their way beneath leafy suburban streets, lie
buried under a phillips 66 and the corner
of a pizza hut where a couple sits slumped
in their booth. yet here and there, like a fish
head breaking the surface of the water, they
emerge in a school teacher's back yard or a
farmer's field, evidence of wagons packed
with hardtack and hard money, thousands of
draft animals tended by traders with blistered
feet, their journey both bleak and romantic.
that's the kind of proof i like, a scar i can put
my hand to, history that will dust my fingers
with a little bit of suffering, a little bit of bone.

each night after reading three books to my two children—
we each picked one—to unwind them into dreamland,
i'd turn off the light and sit between their beds
in the wide junk-shop rocker i'd reupholstered blue,
still feeling the close-reading warmth of their bodies beside me,
and ask them to talk about the day—we did this, we did that, sometimes leading somewhere, sometimes
not, but always ending up at the happy ending of now. now, in still darkness, listening to their breath slow and ease
into sleep's regular rhythm.
grown now, you might've guessed.
the past tense solid, unyielding, against the acidic drip
of recent years. but how it calmed us then, rewinding
the gentle loop, and in the trusting darkness, pressing play.

st. joseph’s hospital, tacoma wa, 1969-74 .a headache makes your mouth plunge, then it pulls away. the smell of diesel or the smell of rain. now you are a thick suburb. under the pressure of a credit card. your body is a box of mirrors, a mercury mine. you have blossomed and spread, white mystery of spring. all your blood and treasure is spent. o rose, you are sick. the morning rain does not nourish you. your mouth is caught in a rigid o. where only deficit is at home. you stand beneath a white hospital, almost drunk. you cannot say why your sense is drenched: exhaustion or debt. what’s the difference again? a braid of eyes. curtains the color of a dove’s wing. ceramic lips framed against seismic shatter. “soft zone.” meanwhile your uncle is dying in san francisco and you do not know it. you are standing in front of another hospital whose patients are strangers. you unwind a rope of carbon so that you can post pictures of it on the internet. how much damage does your life do and how can you refuse? o rose, you are sick. only injury sustains you.

pieces of the quiet, they eat spaces
between the quiet
& the sounds—;
& the numbers on the calendar
lie flat in their boxes,
they leak through tiny holes
in the minutes,
evenly so, so evenly,
an active sense, before
the sense was made…there, now, opposite to set down,
the agreed-upon, the shape
of the obvious
drawn by an earlier
enchantment before the new
anxiety set in:
the workers are safe;
the terror stilled for an hour;
a lover’s outline, dreamed or imagined,
before you read the one-page book
again, what was that book,
it had no copyright—& what was before?
a life, the dazzler, the dark,
the singing dust, it turned
when you turned, it orpheus-knew
what you forgot when you took the bowl
of burning time across the room—
& if the previous is closer
to you now, should you
look, doesn’t matter if you do,
you carry the some of it
with it, out into it.

it was adolphe sax, remember,
not saxo grammaticus, who gets the ovation.
and by the time he had brought all the components
together–the serpentine shape, the single reed,
the fit of the fingers,
the upward tilt of the golden bell–
it was already 1842, and one gets the feeling
that it was also very late at night. there is something nocturnal about the sound,
something literally horny,
as some may have noticed on that historic date
when the first odd notes wobbled out of his studio
into the small, darkened town, summoning the insomniacs (who were up
waiting for the invention of jazz) to their windows,
but leaving the sleepers undisturbed,
evening deepening and warming the waters of their dreams. for this is not the valved instrument of waking,
more the smoky voice of longing and loss,
the porpoise cry of the subconscious.
no one would ever think of blowing reveille
on a tenor without irony.
the men would only lie in their metal bunks,
fingers twined behind their heads,
afloat on pools of memory and desire. and when the time has come to rouse the dead,
you will not see gabriel clipping an alto
around his numinous neck.an angel playing the world’s last song
on a glistening saxophone might be enough
to lift them back into the light of earth,
but really no further. once resurrected, they would only lie down
in the long cemetery grass
or lean alone against a lugubrious yew
and let the music do the ascending–
curling snakes charmed from their baskets–
while they wait for the shrill trumpet solo,
that will blow them all to kingdom come.

always worried bill wd start one
my bedroom / study faced
the molson’s sign and burrard street bridge

days filled with coffee, tea, poetry, cigarette smoke
crises, trips, talkedy talk talk
painting hard edged strong coloured
also intricate silver point mandalas

a gallon of calogna red
one summery saturday night
became a party
of 100 or even more
dancing in my bedroom to one music on a tape recorder
dancing in the other to another
drumming in the kitchen
talking in the room with the blue-tile fireplace
so many bodies i couldnt hear the music
from inside the hallway
just saw the taller heads
moving together to different beats

everybody landing on that bed
everybody kissing everybody

it was gorgeous
after the vancouver poetry conference (1963)
roy kiyooka started
dropping by
when he left his studio
there’d always be a light on
somewhere in our building
and he could visit any of us
separately or clustered
one time
he told me he had a painting he wanted to give me
but it was big and heavy
he borrowed a truck and someone helped him
up the dusty always dirty long stairs
with hoarfrost
which we hung on a wall in a room just big enough to hold
my round oak table
(used to be bowerings’ they bought a whole household of furniture for $80 and
when they moved they gave it to joan and then when she moved she stored it
with me)
a wall that later elsa and i tore apart with a screwdriver and hammer
shouting angry hexes at robert all the way
after and during that conference--
olson, creeley, duncan, levertov, avison, whalen, ginsberg--
roy and i became friends
and there were readings in my room
every second sunday
red cast iron pot full of bean soup, corn chowder, spicey meatball vegetable stew
simmering and then cheese scones in the oven
people would come and read their new work one week
and the next week there’d be a tish meeting
with daphne marlatt, dan macleod, pete auxier, david cull & david dawson
rent $60 a month didnt change
and some years it was cold
the wind so cold on side facing the north shore
that hydro was $60 per month
and that wall frozen behind my pillows
the police were something else
they felt they had a right to question anybody so
cliff would be up at the laundromat on 4th or
at jackson’s to get some hamburger and be walking back with an
economics book in one hand and meat wrapped in brown paper in the other
and they’d stop him and ask him what he was doing and my friend ray wargo
would get stopped almost every second time he’d drop in to visit
where are you going and why and how long will you be
someone was always getting busted
someone was always tripping out
someone was always visiting from
or going to europe or japan
here is a journal entry on june 9:
evening of the first ever national leaders debate on tv
“i am looking forward to seeing trudeau--hope he gets pushed into/onto
answering more directly than he has in the past. i, like many others including
every gay man i know, do have a crush on him: he has much more style than
any canadian politician so far. i mean style in the true sense of the word, it is
him, not affected… cliff, of course, doesn’t trust him at all and thinks he’s a sell-
out. i don’t go that far, yet. but i do think that compromising is the only way a
politician can work this country and i do not like all the pr, razzmatazz,
fundraising, and allegiances that go into just getting elected: our system seems
to be based on gullibility…”
coming home at night up yew street
whether from downtown or the beach or paul the butcher’s or elsie the baker’s

i am forced to sleepwalk much of the time.
we hold on to these old ways, are troubled
sometimes and then the geyser goes away,
time gutted. in and of itself there is
no great roar, force pitted against force that
makes up in time what it loses in speed.
the waterfalls, the canyon, a royal i-told-you-so
comes back to greet us at the beginning.
how was your trip? oh i didn’t last
you see, folded over like the margin
of a dream of the thing-in-itself. well, and
what have we come to? a paper-thin past,
just so, and ‘tis pity. we regurgitate
old anthems and what has come to pass, and why
dwell on these. why make things more difficult
than they already are? because if it’s boring
in a different way, that’ll be interesting too.
that’s what i say. that rascal, he jumped over the fence.
i’m wiping my pince-nez now. did you ever hear from
the one who said he’d be back once it was over,
who eluded me even in my sleep? that was a particularly
promising time, we thought. now the sun’s out
and it’s raining again. just like a day from
the compendium. i’ll vouch for you,
and we can go on scrolling as though nothing had risen,
the horizon forest looks back at us. the preacher
shook his head, the evangelist balanced two spools
at the end of his little makeshift rope. we’d gone too far.
we’d have to come back in a day or so.

disappear black girls at a low volume of sustained public panic is to insinuate the inconstancy of black girls. the disposability of black girls who are prone to disappearance. a body bag somewhere waits with little hoopla about its lot. absence becomes the lot of black girls._________ will eventually accept as fact that absence becomes a lot of black girls. in what becomes the normal day-to-day, black girls are harder to find, _________ would think first, not that there are few attempts to find them. the question isn’t whether black girls often go missing. if no one else, black girls miss each other._________ would be remiss to not recognize how everything is made less in the absence of black girls, if _________ could miss what _________ have never been required to recognize, such as: unlike missing black girls, taking black girls is a western custom. it seems likely that such a statement will soon appear inaccurate: the white space in new textbook editions will have nothing to say about it, if the white spaces behind those textbooks have anything to say about it. that black girls are quintessential american palimpsests is not a question but an anxiety. _________ would rather forget that black girls were made receptacles for what the authors of liberty and independence would not speak. that liberty and independence were imaginable only in the absent-presence of taken black girls, enslaved black girls, black girls on whom a foundational economic system so depended that white men would kill each other and take taken black girls. the constancy of black girls is someone’s anxiety. the soil is thick with hidden black girls, the myth that only quiet black girls are worthwhile black girls. the soil turns as _________ turn away from loud black girls and their cacophonic insistence on black girls._________ have not insisted enough upon the fact of black girls, are often loudly shocked to find black girls disappeared. loud, unsustainable shock has a way of disappearing black girls. outrage, too, has a way of being disappeared.

the first step is to stop just beyond the weight of organs.
the sense of gravity sitting in tissue is like the space between
carcass and curb, before the reek worms into rock pores:
a sleeplessness there, that continual niche-trash. you too once knew what it was to feel impressive. as the bed dissolves
into the walls, the walls disrobe themselves of their edges
and your resolve is now acute in the locking jaw of darkness.
beg to be let. you, like bravery, leave behind the breath-inflated lump, its depths, and its refusal to lace the cells of scars over even
the metaphorical guttings. to manage the act exceeds the box-
and-whisker of lately’s along-going. you’ve grown so accustomed
to mereness that what you call a life no longer houses the sublime.it seems easy to leave. it seems this easy to leave. after

stitching air between here and all of elsewhere. but, still,
inhabit the bodiless second. to possess it is a bearable joy.

strange to remember a visit, really not so
long ago, which now seems, finally, past.
always, it’s a
kind of obvious thing i guess, amazed by that
cycle: that first you anticipate a thing & it seems
far off, the distance has a weight you can feel
hanging on you, & then it’s there – that
point – whatever – which, now, while
it’s happening seems to be constantly slipping away,
“like the sand through your fingers in an old movie,” until
you can only look back on it, & yet you’re still there, staring
at your thoughts in the window of the fire you find yourself before.
we’ve gone over this a thousand times: & here again, combing that
same section of beach or inseam for that – i’m no
longer sure when or exactly where – “& yet” the peering,
unrewarding as it is, in terms of tangible results,
seems so necessary. hope, which is, after all, no more than a splint of thought
projected outwards, “looking to catch” somewhere –
what can i say here? – that the ease or
difficulty of such memories doesn’t preclude
“that harsher necessity” of going on always in
a new place, under different circumstances:
& yet we don’t seem to have changed, it’s
as if these years that have gone by are
all a matter of record, “but if the real
facts were known” we were still reeling from
what seems to have just happened, but which,
“by the accountant’s keeping” occurred years.
ago.
years ago.
it hardly seems possible,
so little, really, has happened. we shore ourselves hour by hour
in anticipation that soon there will be
nothing to do.
“pack a sandwich
& let’s eat later.”
and of course,
the anticipation is quite appropriate, accounting,
for the most part, for whatever activity
we do manage.
eternally buzzing over the time,
unable to live in it…“maybe if we go upaways we can get a better
view.”
but, of course, in that sense, views don’t
improve.
“in the present moment” (if we could only see
it, which is to say, to begin with, stop looking with
such anticipation) what is enfolding before us puts to
rest any necessity for “progression”. so, more of these tracings, as if by some magic
of the phonetic properties of these squiggles…
or
does that only mystify the “power” of “presence" which
is, as well, a sort of postponement.

be endless but won’t be: could’ve been an outfit for the whitney biennial couldn’t afford one, nor did i need it. who cares how you look at the zoo; it’s about the animals, stupid. which reminds me, could’ve been the trail mix i snacked on & which i managed not to purchase myself. it was tuna on whole wheat, lettuce, jalapeños; a one liter bottle of water (poland spring.) asked for tomato too, which the lady forgot. you puerto rican, she asked? don’t think so, said another one in spanish. let me answer. no, what made you think so? the peppers? my economy needs contractions and abbreviations.my economy is not fixed. my economy is broken, mispronounced.my economy has cold feet, even if there are plenty of socks at home. my economy would like to be wholesome and sound. my economy is a gift certificate that is not enough for what i’d like to have,
so i end up spending money at a store that i dislike in the first place and
will never visit again.my economy is a business lunch where i end up paying the bill instead of
the person who’d like me to work with her.my economy consists of performing tasks for which i receive no quantifi-
able pay.my economy grows when it’s enough to buy someone else a drink, or a
meal.my economy does not allow me to say no.my economy pretends to be booming, but instead, is shaky and imploding. it doesn’t matter, because my economy is predicated on virtue, and it posits
that it’s purer than yours. my economy has no exchange value. i’d like to think of my economy as one of resistance and tactical difference. my economy is not a disposable good. there are no surpluses in my economy. i already owe what i just wrote. my economy is derivative, parasitical, and residual. my economy is a hand-me-down. my economy is not environmentally friendly, although it’s not ravaging
non-renewable resources either. my economy doesn’t force me to put my money where my mouth is. were i
to pay for what i say, it would be a different story. thirteen cents a word is not fair trade. my economy mistakes what it means to trade in futures. in theory my economy is not the result of deliberate choice, it is makeshift
and a tag-along. my economy has double standards. my economy has attention deficit disorder. my economy is the symptom of an incurable disease. my economy is not even mine.

the tide pool crumples like a woman
into the smallest version of herself,
bleeding onto whatever touches her. the ocean, i mean, not a woman, filled
with plastic lace, and closer to the vanishing
point, something brown breaks the surface—human, maybe, a hand or foot or an island
of trash—but no, it’s just a garden of kelp.
a wild life. this is a prayer like the sea
urchin is a prayer, like the sea
star is a prayer, like the otter and cucumber—as if i know what prayer means. i call this the difficulty of the non-believer,
or, put another way, waking, every morning, without a god. how to understand, then, what deserves rescue
and what deserves to suffer. who. or should i say, what must
be sheltered and what abandoned. who. i might ask you to imagine a young girl,
no older than ten but also no younger,
on a field trip to a rescue. can you 
see her? she is lead to the gates that separate
the wounded sea lions from their home and the class.
how the girl wishes this measure of salvation for herself: to claim her own barking voice, to revel
in her own scent and sleek brown body, her fingers
woven into the cyclone fence.

i hate the word, and i guess that’s why it is said?
people love to hurt one another.
it is what makes us human.
i do love dogs.
they don’t seem to be evil unless humans make them that way.
dogs can maul and they can sniff out bombs.
they’ll get as close to you as they can while you’re sleeping.
they’ll share heat and scent in the crook of your knees.
is there really a thing such as innocence?
i have desired from birth to live.
daily, i wrestle the tight arms of guilt.
at the shelter, the adoption coach told us that our new dog was highly food motivated.
i have been called a bitch.
our dog trembles when he’s afraid and the only thing we can do is wait for the fear to leave.
there’s no comforting him.
in a dream they held me down, scrawled bitch across my chest in old embers.
they covered my head as a weapon was raised.
i had a dog who once kept me from walking into the arroyo.
she blocked my path and wouldn’t move.
i’ll never know what, or who, she saved me from.

it will be windy for a while until it isn’t. the waves will shoal. a red-legged
cormorant will trace her double along glassy water, forgetting they are hungry.
the sea will play this motif over and over, but there will be no preparing for it
otherwise. water will quiver in driftwood. sound preceding absence,
a white dog trailing a smaller one: ghost and noon shadow, two motes
disappearing into surf. and when the low tide comes lapping and clear, the curled
fronds of seaweed will furl and splay, their algal sisters brushing strands
against sands where littleneck clams feed underwater. light rain will fall
and one cannot help but lean into the uncertainty of the sea. bow: a knot
of two loops, two loose ends, our bodies on either side of this shore where we
will dip our hands to feel what can’t be seen. horseshoe crabs whose blue
blood rich in copper will reach for cover, hinged between clouds and
sea. it will never be enough, the bull kelp like a whip coiling in tender hands,
hands who know to take or be taken, but take nothing with them: i will marry you.
i will marry you. so we can owe what we own to every beautiful thing.

at night you stumble, dreaming
cross-eyed of a chase scene
three yellow wasps on your chest
the city you turned around in
a chase that quickly lands into a fight the nagging anxiety of a stain somewhere
a tickle at the back of the throat
a song’s bridge playing over and over in the head
maybe the stain is at the bottom of your lung
maybe this white crusting along the edge of the bed i lay an icepack on your head
one of the old ones that look like a lazy waterdrop
unable to pop, i’m waiting for a more complete
courage, a peeled orange, a halogen lamp believe it or not, we’re recreating someone
from the 19th century’s sin, by proceeding
mounted on the edge of our bed like
a permanent display, matching burdens
to caramels the thin plant over the dresser is belonging here
you picture yourself with pedals removed
and ask why you were not born gracious
i do a different dance in the same mirror in the ultra-rendering of these buildings
i could snap my fingers
and every window would close
an accordion we accompany

wine makes a person weak

and the dutch with the lenape down in manahatta
there was a dog named charlie
cally called it an ‘it’
when we had our pronoun circle-jerk
i told the group they could call me ‘it’
you know like the sky and the grass and
a bird where you can’t tell what it is
it, its, itself
but then i sort of chickened out and said
if ‘it’ ‘made them feel weird’ as a pronoun for a human
they could call me ‘they’
or any gender-neutral pronoun i said
xe or zae or e or shim-sham or
two head-cocks and a click i joked
looking at charlie’s belly as charlie

autumn
gold of amber
red of ember
brown of umber
all september
mccoy creekover the bright shallows
now no flights of swallows.
leaves of the sheltering willow
dangle thin and yellow. octoberat four in the morning the west wind
moved in the leaves of the beech tree
with a long rush and patter of water,
first wave of the dark tide coming in. solstice on the longest night of all the year
in the forests up the hill,
the little owl spoke soft and clear
to bid the night be longer still. the winds of may are soft and restless
in their leafy garments
that rustle and sway
making every moment movement. hail the dogwood cowered under the thunder
and the lilacs burned like light itself
against the storm-black sky until the hail
whitened the grass with petals.

will haul this gelatinous body, will lash forward this non-form, will push this organism of gas through the gray regions. a sour wind tears through the thin white hair. a wind of vinegar and henbane tears in the rustling, discarded bird-shells that were abandoned empty and fragile when the throbbing bird-boils moved on toward so-called life. now i see the cunning needle-trees sling these clumps of heavy pouch-flesh back and forth between them: small feather-birds “fly” above my heads. i haul myself, i haul myself, i haul my dragging structure along the river furrow’s muddy, sloppily overlapping slopes. i am so bitter, so wet, so the mouth smears the inside with the sweetness of the chewed-up blood-chisel. out of this blood i am going to suck my nourishment for some time. i haul, i urge my dissolved substance, slowly forward across the metal of calm stones, the hovering thread-glue’s suction toward a point in the distant middle of the perspective. where the river’s banks will meet and like the thinnest needle of silver of liquid will drill its dark tunnel-water straight into the heart of the dying image, this moistly broken-up surface of paper to which we cling. i haul i haul i touch myself, touch the skin-rind with chafed-up viscous fingers. little mermaid from ocean foam molded–i haul my long veils, layers of elastic cartilage, of slippery, shimmering membranes, chlorophyll. the gills shudder and glow deep down in this chasm of tissue–constantly rustling, squeaking, gasping for air. this whirling, howling, desperate lack of oxygen; the scream–if it had had enough oxygen to scream and a mouth with which to scream–the scream to swallow the entire lung full of clear wind. lizards play, glitter green, blue, and red between the skin membranes of the body dress. where does this mass end? i search inward through strata to find the core of my plasma wet from juices, to find the core of body-flesh despite the outer, surrounding flesh, the naked body’s stable surface, a kind of human here inside the bluing, plant-becoming. something to hold on to behind the spread of the sickness of mud, fermentation. but there is nothing to grasp beneath this mantle of slippery webbed skin, burst through by a pounding net of veins. i now lick my tongue against the outer claws of the fingers to tear life into the ions, to make sores bitter in the tongue’s blue ventricles. a kind of pain therefore radiates against the inner glands, a faint spasm of cheers before this, the nervous system’s last chance to communicate with the dying i. the mists smart, shimmer, the lumps of blue cobalt from the mustard gas corrode through the otherwise red shroud-clouds that drag their bellies against the river’s surface. in one of the skin-folds between the pockets of the genital dress, lizards gather in heaps of glimmering scales. but time runs on time and starvation and the weakness carries me in across the gray regions. and the soul’s dark night will slowly be lowered through me. that is why i now slowly fold myself like a muscle against the wet clay to press the flesh against the sleep-gland’s mouths. i will sleep now in my bird body in the down, and a bitter star will radiate eternally above the glowing face’s watercourse.

behind the house in a field
there's a metal box i buried
full of childhood treasure, a map
of my secret place, a few lead pennies
from 1943.
the rest i've forgotten,
forgotten even the exact spot
i covered with moss and loam. now i'm back and twenty years
have made so little difference
i suspect they never happened,
this face in the mirror
aged with pencil and putty.
i suspect even
the box has moved as a mole would move
to a new place long ago.
<|endoftext|>

i have scrawled audible lifelines along the edges
of the lint trap, dropping the ball of towel fuzz
in the blue bin lined with a thirteen-gallon bag.
my sons' wardrobes lounge on their bedroom floors,
then sidle down to the basement, where i look
forward to the warmth of their waistbands
when i pluck them from the dryer.
sometimes i wonder why my husband
worries about debt and i wish he wouldn't.
sometimes i wonder how high the alfalfa
will grow. sometimes i wonder if the dog
will throw up in the night. like my mother,
i'm learning not to tamper with anger.
it appears as reliably as the washing machine
thumps and threatens to lurch across the floor
away from the electrical outlet. nothing's worth
getting worked up about, except for death.
and when i think of the people i have lost,
i wish them back into their button-down shirts,
their raspberry tights.

years do odd things to identity.
what does it mean to say
i am that child in the photograph
at kishamish in 1935?
might as well say i am the shadow
of a leaf of the acacia tree
felled seventy years ago
moving on the page the child reads.
might as well say i am the words she read
or the words i wrote in other years,
flicker of shade and sunlight
as the wind moves through the leaves.

mother rain, manifold, measureless,
falling on fallow, on field and forest,
on house-roof, low hovel, high tower,
downwelling waters all-washing, wider
than cities, softer than sisterhood, vaster
than countrysides, calming, recalling:
return to us, teaching our troubled
souls in your ceaseless descent
to fall, to be fellow, to feel to the root,
to sink in, to heal, to sweeten the sea.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
up on the roof, waiting for the fireworks to begin
in warm winter rain, a moment ago i stepped
from the elevator into the black air
of an almost new year
and need a minute to catch my breath
at the spread of city open to my eye.
i can't go to the edge; i never could.
the old fear of height still troubles me,
the sensation that nothing can be under me
if i am surrounded by mist and rain
and all of the dark night air we breathe.
even a glimpse at the treetops in the park,
with its slick crisscrossing roads that plunge
into the jumbled panorama of east side manhattan,
hysterical tonight with its own incandescence,
gives me the willies. i feel as if
i were standing on the deck of a showboat of a cloud
as it drifts down some dark river, waiting for it
to bang into some other building's fifteenth floor.
how can these old people hunch the railing,
hoisting their plastic glasses of champagne
from under dripping umbrellas, as if
they drank the rain as they laugh
their analyses of the weather?
maybe now, like me, they have nothing to lose.
i moved in three weeks ago; this is my first trip
to the roof. i don't want to die tonight,
the first fatality of 1990! there's too much of me
i left in pieces last year, oh, the whole last decade:
but i'm up here to distract myself, temporarily,
from what i don't want or can't have
in the way of love. . . . that must be
the triborough bridge, tied in its strings
of blue lights, and i can see in central park
the skating rink, like a scoured mirror below,
where some madman waves a red lantern; he
must be drunk. i have only sipped a speck of drambuie,
which i didn't carry in my coca-cola glass
up to these festivities. this is the first new year's
i've spent alone in twenty, twenty-two years.
i never could go to the edge; but i did.
out there in the dark: my marriage, the woman
i loved badly, as she did me, or none too well;
the places we lived; the apartment i once half-owned;
the thousands of books i had to leave behind
(though i am to be granted library privileges)
and the black and white cat i really miss.
my wife's with her friends tonight somewhere in brooklyn;
friends of mine out there, too, though i don't know
where. it's just like me to move in the middle
of a telephone company strike. thus, no calls
from anyone—and i don't even have
a telephone yet, so who could call? damp but trying
to smile, i eye the revelers. two young men
and their enormous girlfriends have joined us,
really large women who carry balloons, all ready
to froth in merry champagne. we check
our watches to the screams from swarms
of apartment windows to the west
as the sky lights up with the first furious
bombardment of colored shells. i can see that
red lantern swinging toward the rockets—aha!
so it wasn't a drunk, but the fireworks engineer
preparing to blow the year's last sky
to smithereens for our delight!
i like to follow the tiny spurts of flame
from the launching pad in their heavenward trajectory
as much as i like the rockets' red glare,
the bombs bursting in air, which give proof
to the night that i am still here, hands
jammed in the pockets of my sodden raincoat,
face dripping with rain, hat soaked, wondering
if the skinny guy in the army jacket behind me
(who looks just like i did in the sixties)
is mumbling his way into a combat flashback
and ready to hurl me over the edge of the roof
and into kingdom come. i guess not yet. we've
survived the first blasts of spinning green,
corkscrews of spangled flame, buds of fireballs
spewed in arching gold sprays, the whistling fire-fish
that curl and howl as they flare, falling to ash.
screaming its head off, the new york new year enters.
i feel sad that beautiful things must die,
even shadows made of smoke and flame,
whatever i thought i had made out of my life—
music, poems, books, kisses, a little useless fame.
the army guy behind me grumbles at the haze
of rocket smoke that coils around the trees,
then tumbles up into the air toward harlem.
that bump and thud and bump sound everywhere,
more clouds smacking each other head-on.
the flashes of the explosions are close enough
to touch if you wanted to burn your fingers
on the sky, and the glare rocks our shadows back
against the brick, as if chaos snapped
our pictures in the dark. i smile for my portrait,
curious at the new year, smelling the acrid smoke
of the one we've just destroyed. then i squeeze into
the tiny elevator car with the others, anonymous,
reconciled to be so, back to my little apartment
and the waiting glass of amber drink i'll raise,
only half in jest, to my new life.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
that's what the first line says
of the song i've been playing all summer
at the keyboard—trying to get my hands
around its dark, melancholy chords,
its story line of a melody that twists
up like snakes from melodic minor scales
that i've also been trying to learn, though
i'm no great shakes as a practicer of scales.
come to think of it, neither am i much
when it comes to love—no great shakes, i mean.
not that i haven't had my chances.
twenty years married, i made a lousy husband,
half asleep, selfish, more like a big baby
than a grown man, the poet laureate
of the self-induced coma when it came to
doing anything for anybody but me.
"now and then he took his thumb
out of his mouth to write an ode to
or a haiku about the thumb he sucked all day."
that's what i imagined my ex-wife said
to our therapist near the end. she did say:
"it's all about bill." she was right.
and suddenly it frightens me, remembering
how, at our wedding, our poet friends
read poems of (mostly) utter depression
to salute us. i wondered if their griefs in love
had double-crossed our union, if strange
snakes in the grass of our blissful eden
had hissed at us, and now i worry,
on your wedding day, if i'm not
doing the same damned thing . . . .
i haven't come to spring up and put my curse
on your bliss. here's what i want to say:
you're young. you don’t know what love is.
and as the next line of the song goes, you won't
—"until you know the meaning of the blues."
darlings, the blues will come (though not
often, i hope) to raise their fiery swords
against your paradise. a little of that
you unwittingly got today, when it rained
and you couldn't be married outside under
the beautiful tree in nan and alan's yard.
but paradise doesn't have to be structured
so that we can never reenter it. after
you've kicked each other out of it
once or twice (i'm speaking metaphorically,
of course), teach yourself how to say
a few kind words to each other.
don't stand there angry, stony.
each of you let the other know
what you are feeling and thinking
and then it may be possible
to return to each other smiling,
hand in hand. for arm in arm,
you are your best eden. remember
the advice the old poet sang to you
on the afternoon of august 4, 2001,
the day you got married.
may you enjoy a good laugh
thinking of him and his silver thumb
now that you've turned the key
into your new life in the beautiful
massachusetts rain and—hey, now—sun!
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
not long after you had told me, gently,
that you still grieved for your last love,
though that had ended almost a year before,
and that you could have no intimate relationship
with me, maybe not with anyone for a time,
i stopped my fork in the air with whatever hung
on the end of it that i was eating.
my throat wouldn't swallow.
i felt weak and sick, as if it were myself
that i devoured, piece by piece, as you talked away
the hopes that i had put in your lovely face.
it was the old story coming true for me once more,
though you were hardly mine. . . .
when we finished i walked you back to your car;
i don't remember having much to say.
why would i? buildings drifted by,
and cars, and faces. then we arrived at the place
where, afterwards, i would never see you again,
at a parking lot near times square.
there i marked the sidewalk with x's
visible only to me: "at this place
i was lost again," they'd say to me
when i walked there in the future.
"dig here and find what's left of me,
or what i left behind, where x marks the spot."
i felt like the death's-head and crossed bones
that surmount the treasure chest.
i only felt a little like gold coins and jewels.
i have signed the city with these sphinxes
—in parks, in streets, in bedrooms,
in my own apartments. and there we stood,
you and i, hemmed in by the stitches of x's
that could not hold you to me. but x's
mean kisses, i realized, as well as
what is lost: all the kisses i couldn't give you
chalked like symbols on the sidewalk.
after all, you yourself had been marked
by loss, even in your laughter that afternoon
at the show i had taken you to. bright-eyed
and smiling in the seat beside me, you
stole my glances with your dark, dark eyes
and your long hair. i thought that i had not been
this happy in a long time with a woman
and was ready to become even more happy,
ready to do anything that you wanted
in order to please you, to see that smile come up,
not knowing what you were soon to say to me
as we dined. and when you spoke,
i felt life fall away from me. again i felt
that i would never be happy. i felt the words
that i had wanted to say to you leaving me, rushing
out of my chest like dead air, until i had no more words
to say. i seemed to cut and swallow my food
as if it were me myself that stuck in pieces
on the end of the fork i had raised to my mouth.
had i been chewing on my own flesh?
self-pity the devourer took me by the hand
that held the fork, and once again i feasted
on all that was dark and hopeless in myself,
in lieu of all that was beautiful, desirable,
and unattainable in you. and then
i stood beside you in the lot where you
had parked your car, with the x's buzzing
in the air, sticking themselves to you
and me and the blacktop and the cars.
when you reached out to embrace me, i
moved to embrace you in return—and then came
the part that i don't want to remember,
the part i hate: i caught a glimpse of your
face as we put our arms around each other,
and your face said everything to me about
how you had wasted the afternoon, how eager
you were to speed away in your car, a mixture
of disgust and relief that the thing would soon
be over, that i would be crossed out forever
from your life—and everything that i hated
about myself, my stupid chin, my ugly nose,
my hopeless balded head, my stuck-out ears,
my wreck of a heart, crashed over me,
spinning me into the vortex of a palpable self-hate
that i have only ever let myself feel
a little bit at a time, though it is always there

like a robot that falls and makes good for a switch
like the breasts of a mop that soaks blood
like a magnifying glass for the sun
like the picture of radar in space
like a misery flood on the phone
like electrical laughter that the pointed shake
like enemies held in a double embrace
like extinctions returning
like a handshake of style for the heat
like the flower that bottles a fly for a mouth
like the still dunes of dust on a beautiful girl
like the crack in an oven

—susan sontag i place a photograph of my uncle on my computer desktop, which means i learn to ignore it. he stands by a tank, helmet tilting to his right, bootlaces tightened as if stitching together a wound. alive the hand brings up a cigarette we won't see him taste. last night i smoked one on the steps outside my barn apartment. a promise i broke myself. he promised himself he wouldn't and did. i smell my fingers and i am smelling his. hands of smoke and gunpowder. hands that promised they wouldn't, but did. 
this album is a stop-loss. by a dim lantern
or in the latrine
he flips through it.
he looks at himself
looking nearly as he does—
closest to himself then
as he could be, just learning
how to lean into his new body.
he suspends there
by standing order,
a spreading fire in his chest,
his groin. he is on stage
for us to see him, see him?
he stands in the noontime sun.a young soldier (pictured above) the son of an imam, brother to six, is among the latest casualties in the military campaign of susangerd. your whole body in a photo your whole body sitting on a crate pressing your eyesocket to the viewfinder of a bazooka crouched as you balance the metal tube on your shoulder in one you guide a belt of ammo into the untiring weapon proud your elbow out as if mid-waltz your frame strong and lightly supporting the gun a kind of smile ruining the picture 
you’re posing. you’re scared.
a body falls
and you learn to step over
a loosened head. you begin to appreciate
the heft of your boot soles,
how they propel you,
how they can kick in
a face–
the collapse
of a canopy bed
in an aerial bombardment,
mosquito netting doused
in napalm–cheekbones fragile
as moth wings beneath the heel.
you tighten your laces
until they hold together
a capable man.
whatever rains,
the weight of your feet
swings you forward,
goose-stepping pendulums
a body less and less yours–
a body, god knows,
is not what makes you
anyway. so the hands
that said they never would
begin finding
grenade pins around their fingers,
begin flipping through this album
with soot under their nails
you were not ready
but they issued the shovel and the rifle and you dug
but to watch you sitting there between the sandbags
but to watch the sand spilling out the bullet holes
but what did they expect
but what did they really think a sheet of metal could prevent
but i sat rolling little ears of pasta off my thumb like helmets
but it was not a table of fallen men
but my hand registered fatigue
but the men in fatigues were tired of sleeping in shifts
but you snuck into town and dialed home until you wrote your fingers
were tired
but the code for shiraz was down
but all of shiraz was down
but the sheet lightning above the ferris wheel of rusted bolts
but i am sure they are alright you wrote well to reassure yourself
but the wind like an old mouth shaking the unnamed evergreen outside
my window
but what i mean is i'd like very much to talk a bit hello operation ramadan was an offensive in the iran-iraq war. it was launched by iran in july 1982 near basra and featured the use of human wave attacks in one of the largest land battles since world war ii. aftermath: the operation was the first of many disastrous offensives which cost thousands of lives on both sides. this one in general boosted the casualty limit up to 80,000 killed, 200,000 wounded, and 45,000 captured. in retrospect, the iranians lacked effective command and control, air support, and logistics to sustain an attack in the first place. saddam hussein offered several ceasefire attempts in the following year, none of which were accepted by the revolutionary regime.

when he tells the story now
he's at the center of it,
everyone else in the house
falling into the backdrop—
my mother, grandmother,
an uncle, all dead now—props
in our story: father and daughter
caught in memory's half-light.
i'm too young to recall it,
so his story becomes the story:
1969, hurricane camille
bearing down, the old house
shuddering as if it will collapse.
rain pours into every room
and he has to keep moving,
keep me out of harm's way—
a father's first duty: to protect.
and so, in the story, he does:
i am small in his arms, perhaps
even sleeping. water is rising
around us and there is no
higher place he can take me
than this, memory forged
in the storm's eye: a girl
clinging to her father. what
can i do but this? let him
tell it again and again as if
it's always been only us,
and that, when it mattered,
he was the one who saved me.

in which i try to decipher
the story it tells,
this syntax of monuments flanking the old courthouse:
here, a rough outline
like the torso of a woman great with child—a steatite boulder from which the indians girdled the core
to make of it a bowl, and left in the stone a wound; here,
the bronze figure of thomas jefferson, quill in hand, inscribing a language of freedom, a creation story—his hand poised at the word happiness. there is not yet an ending, no period—the single mark,
intended or misprinted, that changes the meaning of everything.
here too, for the confederacy,
an obelisk, oblivious
in its name—a word that also meant the symbol
to denote, in ancient manuscripts, the spurious, corrupt, or doubtful;
at its base, forged in concrete, a narrative of valor, virtue, states' rights. 
here, it is only the history of a word, obelisk, that points us toward what's not there; all of it
palimpsest, each mute object repeating a single refrain: remember this.

thus, weary of life, in view of the great consummation which awaits us — tomorrow, we rush among our friends congratulating ourselves upon the joy soon to be. thoughtless of evil we crush out the marrow of those about us with our heavy cars as we go happily from place to place. it seems that there is not time enough in which to speak the full of our exaltation. only a day is left, one miserable day, before the world comes into its own. let us hurry ! why bother for this man or that ? in the offices of the great newspapers a mad joy reigns as they prepare the final extras. rushing about, men bump each other into the whirring presses. how funny it seems. all thought of misery has left us. why should we care ? children laughingly fling themselves under the wheels of the street cars, airplanes crash gaily to the earth. someone has written a poem. oh life, bizarre fowl, what color are your wings ? green, blue, red, yellow, purple, white, brown, orange, black, grey ? in the imagination, flying above the wreck of ten thousand million souls, i see you departing sadly for the land of plants and insects, already far out to sea. (thank you, i know well what i am plagiarising) your great wings flap as you disappear in the distance over the pre-columbian acres of floating weed. the new cathedral overlooking the park, looked down from its towers today, with great eyes, and saw by the decorative lake a group of people staring curiously at the corpse of a suicide : peaceful, dead young man, the money they have put into the stones has been spent to teach men of life’s austerity. you died and teach us the same lesson. you seem a cathedral, celebrant of the spring which shivers for me among the long black trees.

leaning forward to look up into the man’s half
averted face and a boy of eight who was
looking at the middle of the man’s belly
at a watchchain —the supreme importance
of this nameless spectacle sped me by them

you tell me i am wrong.
who are you, who is anybody to tell me i am wrong?
i am not wrong.in syracuse, rock left bare by the viciousness of greek women,
no doubt you have forgotten the pomegranate trees in flower,
oh so red, and such a lot of them. whereas at venice,
abhorrent, green, slippery city
whose doges were old, and had ancient eyes,
in the dense foliage of the inner garden
pomegranates like bright green stone,
and barbed, barbed with a crown.
oh, crown of spiked green metal
actually growing! now, in tuscany,
pomegranates to warm your hands at;
and crowns, kingly, generous, tilting crowns
over the left eyebrow. and, if you dare, the fissure! do you mean to tell me you will see no fissure?
do you prefer to look on the plain side? for all that, the setting suns are open.
the end cracks open with the beginning:
rosy, tender, glittering within the fissure.do you mean to tell me there should be no fissure?
no glittering, compact drops of dawn?
do you mean it is wrong, the gold-filmed skin, integument,

from that shallow-silvery wine-glass on a short stem
this rolling, dropping, heavy globule? i am thinking, of course, of the peach before i ate it. why so velvety, why so voluptuous heavy?
why hanging with such inordinate weight?
why so indented? why the groove?
why the lovely, bivalve roundnesses?
why the ripple down the sphere?
why the suggestion of incision? why was not my peach round and finished like a billiard ball?
it would have been if man had made it.

i love you, rotten,
delicious rottenness. i love to suck you out from your skins
so brown and soft and coming suave,
so morbid, as the italians say. what a rare, powerful, reminiscent flavour
comes out of your falling through the stages of decay:
stream within stream. something of the same flavour as syracusan muscat wine
or vulgar marsala. though even the word marsala will smack of preciosity
soon in the pussy-foot west. what is it?
what is it, in the grape turning raisin,
in the medlar, in the sorb-apple,
wineskins of brown morbidity,
autumnal excrementa;
what is it that reminds us of white gods? gods nude as blanched nut-kernels,
strangely, half-sinisterly flesh-fragrant
as if with sweat,
and drenched with mystery. sorb-apples, medlars with dead crowns.
i say, wonderful are the hellish experiences,
orphic, delicate
dionysos of the underworld. a kiss, and a vivid spasm of farewell, a moment’s orgasm of rupture,
then along the damp road alone, till the next turning.
and there, a new partner, a new parting, a new unfusing into twain,
a new gasp of further isolation,
a new intoxication of loneliness, among decaying, frost-cold leaves. going down the strange lanes of hell, more and more intensely alone,
the fibres of the heart parting one after the other
and yet the soul continuing, naked-footed, ever more vividly embodied
like a flame blown whiter and whiter
in a deeper and deeper darkness,
ever more exquisite, distilled in separation.so, in the strange retorts of medlars and sorb-apples
the distilled essence of hell.
the exquisite odour of leave-taking. jamque vale!
orpheus, and the winding, leaf-clogged, silent lanes of hell. each soul departing with its own isolation.
strangest of all strange companions,
and best. medlars, sorb-apples
more than sweet
flux of autumn
sucked out of your empty bladders
and sipped down, perhaps, with a sip of marsala
so that the rambling, sky-dropped grape can add its music to yours,
orphic farewell, and farewell, and farewell
and the ego sum of dionysos
the sono io of perfect drunkenness
intoxication of final loneliness.

a snake came to my water-trough
on a hot, hot day, and i in pyjamas for the heat,
to drink there.in the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree
i came down the steps with my pitcher
and must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough
before me. he reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom
and trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over
the edge of the stone trough
and rested his throat upon the stone bottom,
and where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,
he sipped with his straight mouth,
softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,
silently. someone was before me at my water-trough,
and i, like a second-comer, waiting. he lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,
and looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,
and flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused
a moment,
and stooped and drank a little more,
being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels
of the earth
on the day of sicilian july, with etna smoking. the voice of my education said to me
he must be killed,
for in sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold
are venomous. and voices in me said, if you were a man
you would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off. but must i confess how i liked him,
how glad i was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink
at my water-trough
and depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,
into the burning bowels of this earth? was it cowardice, that i dared not kill him?
was it perversity, that i longed to talk to him?
was it humility, to feel so honoured?
i felt so honoured. and yet those voices: if you were not afraid, you would kill him! and truly i was afraid, i was most afraid,
but even so, honoured still more
that he should seek my hospitality
from out the dark door of the secret earth. he drank enough
and lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,
and flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,
seeming to lick his lips,
and looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,
and slowly turned his head,
and slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,
proceeded to draw his slow length curving round
and climb again the broken bank of my wall-face. and as he put his head into that dreadful hole,
and as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders,
and entered farther,
a sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into
that horrid black hole,
deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing
himself after,
overcame me now his back was turned. i looked round, i put down my pitcher,
i picked up a clumsy log
and threw it at the water-trough with a clatter. i think it did not hit him,
but suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed
in an undignified haste,
writhed like lightning, and was gone
into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,
at which, in the intense still noon, i stared with fascination. and immediately i regretted it.
i thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!
i despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education. and i thought of the albatross,
and i wished he would come back, my snake. for he seemed to me again like a king,
like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,
now due to be crowned again. and so, i missed my chance with one of the lords
of life.
and i have something to expiate:
a pettiness. taormina

like young poplars fringing the loire eyes that are full of love
and eyes that are full of kohl
projecting light across the fulsome ambiente

telling of tales without words

one way or another the young lovers hermetically buttoned up in black
to black cravat
to the blue powder edge dusting the yellow throat
what color could have been your bodies
when last you put them away nostalgic youth
holding your mistress's pricked finger
in the indifferent flame of the taper
synthetic symbol of life
in this factitious chamber of death
the woman
as usual
is smiling as bravely
as it is given to her to be brave while the brandy cherries
in winking glasses
are decomposing
harmoniously
with the flesh of spectators
and at a given spot
there is one
who
having the concentric lighting focussed precisely upon her
prophetically blossoms in perfect putrefaction
yet there are cabs outside the door.

man of absolute physical equilibrium
you stand so straight on your legs
every plank or clod you plant your feet on

you are more heavy

so at the same time

the essence of a mademoiselle genée
winks in the to-and-fro of your cuff-links your projectile nose
has meddled in the more serious business
of the battle-field

that it snuffles the trail of the female

passing odors of love your genius
so much less in your brain than in your body
reinforcing the hitherto negligible qualities

you leave others their initial strength

driven of the spirit, long have i sought to temper it unto the spirit’s

i am weak with much giving.
i am weak the desire to give more.
(how strong a thing is the little finger!)
so weak that i have confused the body with the soul,

every morning, my grandmother cleaned the fischer stove
in the back of the trailer, lifted ash in a shovel, careful not to spill the white-gray dust. precious, she said, her breath
smoking in the cold. precious in winter's first lavender not-quite-light—and you could smell it, the faintest acrid hint
of ash, a crispness calling you from bed. you could watch her cap it in a chicory coffee can to stack among others, back bent
from a long-gone fever. for the garden in spring, she said.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
when you, that at this moment are to me
dearer than words on paper, shall depart,
and be no more the warder of my heart,
whereof again myself shall hold the key;
and be no more—what now you seem to be—
the sun, from which all excellences start
in a round nimbus, nor a broken dart
of moonlight, even, splintered on the sea;
i shall remember only of this hour—
and weep somewhat, as now you see me weep—
the pathos of your love, that, like a flower,
fearful of death yet amorous of sleep,
droops for a moment and beholds, dismayed,
the wind whereon its petals shall be laid.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
pity me not because the light of day
at close of day no longer walks the sky;
pity me not for beauties passed away
from field and thicket as the year goes by;
pity me not the waning of the moon,
nor that the ebbing tide goes out to sea,
nor that a man’s desire is hushed so soon,
and you no longer look with love on me.
this have i known always: love is no more
than the wide blossom which the wind assails,
than the great tide that treads the shifting shore,
strewing fresh wreckage gathered in the gales:
pity me that the heart is slow to learn
what the swift mind beholds at every turn.

oh, oh, you will be sorry for that word!
give back my book and take my kiss instead.
was it my enemy or my friend i heard,
“what a big book for such a little head!”
come, i will show you now my newest hat,
and you may watch me purse my mouth and prink!
oh, i shall love you still, and all of that.
i never again shall tell you what i think.
i shall be sweet and crafty, soft and sly;
you will not catch me reading any more:
i shall be called a wife to pattern by;
and some day when you knock and push the door,
some sane day, not too bright and not too stormy,
i shall be gone, and you may whistle for me.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
i shall go back again to the bleak shore
and build a little shanty on the sand,
in such a way that the extremest band
of brittle seaweed will escape my door
but by a yard or two; and nevermore
shall i return to take you by the hand;
i shall be gone to what i understand,
and happier than i ever was before.
the love that stood a moment in your eyes,
the words that lay a moment on your tongue,
are one with all that in a moment dies,
a little under-said and over-sung.
but i shall find the sullen rocks and skies
unchanged from what they were when i was young.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
loving you less than life, a little less
than bitter-sweet upon a broken wall
or brush-wood smoke in autumn, i confess
i cannot swear i love you not at all.
for there is that about you in this light—
a yellow darkness, sinister of rain—
which sturdily recalls my stubborn sight
to dwell on you, and dwell on you again.
and i am made aware of many a week
i shall consume, remembering in what way
your brown hair grows about your brow and cheek
and what divine absurdities you say:
till all the world, and i, and surely you,
will know i love you, whether or not i do.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
i, being born a woman and distressed
by all the needs and notions of my kind,
am urged by your propinquity to find
your person fair, and feel a certain zest
to bear your body’s weight upon my breast:
so subtly is the fume of life designed,
to clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,
and leave me once again undone, possessed.
think not for this, however, the poor treason
of my stout blood against my staggering brain,
i shall remember you with love, or season
my scorn with pity,—let me make it plain:
i find this frenzy insufficient reason
for conversation when we meet again.

still will i harvest beauty where it grows:
in coloured fungus and the spotted fog
surprised on foods forgotten; in ditch and bog
filmed brilliant with irregular rainbows
of rust and oil, where half a city throws
its empty tins; and in some spongy log
whence headlong leaps the oozy emerald frog. . . .
and a black pupil in the green scum shows.
her the inhabiter of divers places
surmising at all doors, i push them all.
oh, you that fearful of a creaking hinge
turn back forevermore with craven faces,
i tell you beauty bears an ultra fringe
unguessed of you upon her gossamer shawl!

euclid alone has looked on beauty bare.
let all who prate of beauty hold their peace,
and lay them prone upon the earth and cease
to ponder on themselves, the while they stare
at nothing, intricately drawn nowhere
in shapes of shifting lineage; let geese
gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release
from dusty bondage into luminous air.
o blinding hour, o holy, terrible day,
when first the shaft into his vision shone
of light anatomized! euclid alone
has looked on beauty bare. fortunate they
who, though once only and then but far away,
have heard her massive sandal set on stone.

the white bark writhed and sputtered like a fish
upon the coals, exuding odorous smoke
she knelt and blew, in a surging desolate wish
for comfort; and the sleeping ashes woke
and scattered to the hearth, but no thin fire
broke suddenly, the wood was wet with rain.
then, softly stepping forth from her desire,
(being mindful of like passion hurled in vain
upon a similar task, in other days)
she thrust her breath against the stubborn coal,
bringing to bear upon its hilt the whole
of her still body. . . there sprang a little blaze. . .
a pack of hounds, the flame swept up the flue!—
and the blue night stood flattened against the window,
staring through.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
she had forgotten how the august night
was level as a lake beneath the moon,
in which she swam a little, losing sight
of shore; and how the boy, who was at noon
simple enough, not different from the rest,
wore now a pleasant mystery as he went,
which seemed to her an honest enough test
whether she loved him, and she was content.
so loud, so loud the million crickets’ choir. . .
so sweet the night, so long-drawn-out and late. . .
and if the man were not her spirit’s mate,
why was her body sluggish with desire?
stark on the open field the moonlight fell,
but the oak tree’s shadow was deep and black and
secret as a well.

<|startoftext|>
then said a teacher, speak to us of teach-
ing.
and he said:
no man can reveal to you aught but that
which already lies half asleep in the dawn-
ing of your knowledge.
the teacher who walks in the shadow of
the temple, among his followers, gives not
of his wisdom but rather of his faith and
his lovingness.
if he is indeed wise he does not bid you
enter the house of his wisdom, but rather
leads you to the threshold of your own
mind.
the astronomer may speak to you of his
understanding of space, but he cannot give
you his understanding.
the musician may sing to you of the
rhythm which is in all space, but he cannot
give you the ear which arrests the rhythm
nor the voice that echoes it.
and he who is versed in the science of
numbers can tell of the regions of weight
and measure, but he cannot conduct you
thither.
for the vision of one man lends not its
wings to another man.
and even as each one of you stands alone
in god’s knowledge, so must each one of
you be alone in his knowledge of god and
in his understanding of the earth.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
then a hermit, who visited the city once
a year, came forth and said, speak to us of
pleasure.
and he answered, saying:
pleasure is a freedom-song,
but it is not freedom.
it is the blossoming of your desires,
but it is not their fruit.
it is a depth calling unto a height,
but it is not the deep nor the high.
it is the caged taking wing,
but it is not space encompassed.
ay, in very truth, pleasure is a freedom-
song.
and i fain would have you sing it with
fullness of heart; yet i would not have you
lose your hearts in the singing.
some of your youth seek pleasure as if it
were all, and they are judged and rebuked.
i would not judge nor rebuke them. i
would have them seek.
for they shall find pleasure, but not her
alone;
seven are her sisters, and the least of them
is more beautiful than pleasure.
have you not heard of the man who was
digging in the earth for roots and found a
treasure? and some of your elders remember
pleasures with regret like wrongs com-
mitted in drunkenness.
but regret is the beclouding of the mind
and not its chastisement.
they should remember their pleasures with
gratitude, as they would the harvest of a
summer.
yet if it comforts them to regret, let them
be comforted. and there are among you those who are
neither young to seek nor old to remember;
and in their fear of seeking and remem-
bering they shun all pleasures, lest they
neglect the spirit or offend against it.
but even in their foregoing is their
pleasure.
and thus they too find a treasure though
they dig for roots with quivering hands.
but tell me, who is he that can offend the
spirit?
shall the nightingale offend the stillness of
the night, or the firefly the stars?
and shall your flame or your smoke
burden the wind?
think you the spirit is a still pool which
you can trouble with a staff? oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure
you do but store the desire in the recesses
of your being.
who knows but that which seems omitted
today, waits for tomorrow?
even your body knows its heritage and
its rightful need and will not be deceived.
and your body is the harp of your soul,
and it is yours to bring forth sweet
music from it or confused sounds. and now you ask in your heart, “how
shall we distinguish that which is good in
pleasure from that which is not good?”
go to your fields and your gardens, and
you shall learn that it is the pleasure of
the bee to gather honey of the flower,
but it is also the pleasure of the flower
to yield its honey to the bee.
for to the bee a flower is a fountain of
life,
and to the flower a bee is a messenger of
love,
and to both, bee and flower, the giving
and the receiving of pleasure is a need and
an ecstasy. people of orphalese, be in your pleas-
ures like the flowers and the bees.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
and a poet said, speak to us of beauty.
and he answered:
where shall you seek beauty, and how
shall you find her unless she herself be your
way and your guide?
and how shall you speak of her except
she be the weaver of your speech? the aggrieved and the injured say,
“beauty is kind and gentle.
like a young mother half-shy of her
own glory she walks among us.”
and the passionate say, “nay, beauty is
a thing of might and dread.
like the tempest she shakes the earth
beneath us and the sky above us.” the tired and the weary say, “beauty is
of soft whisperings. she speaks in our spirit.
her voice yields to our silences like a faint
light that quivers in fear of the shadow.”
but the restless say, “we have heard her
shouting among the mountains,
and with her cries came the sound of
hoofs, and the beating of wings and
the roaring of lions.” at night the watchmen of the city say,
“beauty shall rise with the dawn from the
east.”
and at noontide the toilers and the way-
farers say, “we have seen her leaning over
the earth from the windows of the sunset.” in winter say the snow-bound, “she shall
come with the spring leaping upon the hills.”
and in the summer heat the reapers say,
“we have seen her dancing with the autumn
leaves, and we saw a drift of snow in her
hair.”
all these things have you said of beauty,
yet in truth you spoke not of her but of
needs unsatisfied,
and beauty is not a need but an ecstasy.
it is not a mouth thirsting nor an empty
hand stretched forth,
but rather a heart enflamed and a soul en-
chanted.
it is not the image you would see nor the
song you would hear,
but rather an image you see though you
close your eyes and a song you hear though
you shut your ears.
it is not the sap within the furrowed bark,
nor a wing attached to a claw,
but rather a garden for ever in bloom and
a flock of angels for ever in flight. people of orphalese, beauty is life when
life unveils her holy face.
but you are life and you are the veil.
beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mir-
ror.
but you are eternity and you are the mir-
ror.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
then a lawyer said, but what of our laws,
master?
and he answered:
you delight in laying down laws,
yet you delight more in breaking them.
like children playing by the ocean who
build sand-towers with constancy and then
destroy them with laughter.
but while you build your sand-towers the
ocean brings more sand to the shore,
and when you destroy them the ocean
laughs with you.
verily the ocean laughs always with the
innocent. but what of those to whom life is not an
ocean, and man-made laws are not sand-
towers,
but to whom life is a rock, and the law
a chisel with which they would carve it in
their own likeness?
what of the cripple who hates dancers?
what of the ox who loves his yoke and
deems the elk and deer of the forest
stray and vagrant things?
what of the old serpent who cannot
shed his skin, and calls all others naked
and shameless?
and of him who comes early to the
wedding-feast, and when over-fed and tired
goes his way saying that all feasts are
violation and all feasters lawbreakers? what shall i say of these save that they
too stand in the sunlight, but with their
backs to the sun?
they see only their shadows, and their
shadows are their laws.
and what is the sun to them but a caster
of shadows?
and what is it to acknowledge the laws
but to stoop down and trace their shadows
upon the earth?
but you who walk facing the sun, what
images drawn on the earth can hold you?
you who travel with the wind, what
weather-vane shall direct your course?
what man’s law shall bind you if you
break your yoke but upon no man's prison
door?
what laws shall you fear if you dance
but stumble against no man’s iron chains?
and who is he that shall bring you to
judgment if you tear off your garment yet
leave it in no man’s path? people of orphalese, you can muffle the
drum, and you can loosen the strings of the
lyre, but who shall command the skylark
not to sing?
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
and an orator said, speak to us of free-
dom.
and he answered:
at the city gate and by your fireside i
have seen you prostrate yourself and worship
your own freedom,
even as slaves humble themselves before
a tyrant and praise him though he slays
them.
ay, in the grove of the temple and in
the shadow of the citadel i have seen the
freest among you wear their freedom as a
yoke and a handcuff.
and my heart bled within me; for you
can only be free when even the desire of
seeking freedom becomes a harness to you,
and when you cease to speak of freedom
as a goal and a fulfilment. you shall be free indeed when your days
are not without a care nor your nights with-
out a want and a grief,
but rather when these things girdle your
life and yet you rise above them naked and
unbound. and how shall you rise beyond your
days and nights unless you break the chains
which you at the dawn of your under-
standing have fastened around your noon
hour?
in truth that which you call freedom is
the strongest of these chains, though its
links glitter in the sun and dazzle your eyes.
and what is it but fragments of your own
self you would discard that you may become
free?
if it is an unjust law you would abolish,
that law was written with your own hand
upon your own forehead.
you cannot erase it by burning your law
books nor by washing the foreheads of your
judges, though you pour the sea upon them.
and if it is a despot you would dethrone,
see first that his throne erected within you is
destroyed.
for how can a tyrant rule the free and
the proud, but for a tyranny in their own
freedom and a shame in their own pride?
and if it is a care you would cast off, that
care has been chosen by you rather than
imposed upon you.
and if it is a fear you would dispel, the
seat of that fear is in your heart and not in
the hand of the feared.
verily all things move within your being
in constant half embrace, the desired and
the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished,
the pursued and that which you would
escape.
these things move within you as lights
and shadows in pairs that cling.
and when the shadow fades and is no
more, the light that lingers becomes a
shadow to another light.
and thus your freedom when it loses its
fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater
freedom.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
and the weaver said, speak to us of
clothes.
and he answered:
your clothes conceal much of your beauty,
yet they hide not the unbeautiful.
and though you seek in garments the
freedom of privacy you may find in them
a harness and a chain.
would that you could meet the sun
and the wind with more of your skin and less
of your raiment,
for the breath of life is in the sunlight
and the hand of life is in the wind.
some of you say, “it is the north wind
who has woven the clothes we wear.”
and i say, ay, it was the north wind,
but shame was his loom, and the soften-
ing of the sinews was his thread.
and when his work was done he laughed
in the forest.
forget not that modesty is for a shield
against the eye of the unclean.
and when the unclean shall be no more,
what were modesty but a fetter and a fouling
of the mind?
and forget not that the earth delights to
feel your bare feet and the winds long to
play with your hair.

and a merchant said, speak to us of
buying and selling.
and he answered and said:
to you the earth yields her fruit, and you
shall not want if you but know how to fill
your hands.
it is in exchanging the gifts of the earth
that you shall find abundance and be satisfied.
yet unless the exchange be in love and
kindly justice, it will but lead some to greed
and others to hunger. when in the market place you toilers of
the sea and fields and vineyards meet the
weavers and the potters and the gatherers of
spices,—
invoke then the master spirit of the earth,
to come into your midst and sanctify the
scales and the reckoning that weighs value
against value. and suffer not the barren-handed to take
part in your transactions, who would sell
their words for your labour.
to such men you should say,
“come with us to the field, or go with
our brothers to the sea and cast your net;
for the land and the sea shall be bountiful
to you even as to us.” and if there come the singers and the
dancers and the flute players,—buy of their
gifts also.
for they too are gatherers of fruit and
frankincense, and that which they bring,
though fashioned of dreams, is raiment
and food for your soul. and before you leave the market place,
see that no one has gone his way with
empty hands.
for the master spirit of the earth shall
not sleep peacefully upon the wind till the
needs of the least of you are satisfied.

then almitra spoke again and said, and
what of marriage, master?
and he answered saying:
you were born together, and together you
shall be forevermore.
you shall be together when the white
wings of death scatter your days.
ay, you shall be together even in the
silent memory of god.
but let there be spaces in your togetherness,
and let the winds of the heavens dance
between you. love one another, but make not a bond
of love:
let it rather be a moving sea between
the shores of your souls.
fill each other’s cup but drink not from
one cup.
give one another of your bread but eat
not from the same loaf.
sing and dance together and be joyous,
but let each one of you be alone,
even as the strings of a lute are alone
though they quiver with the same music. give your hearts, but not into each
other’s keeping.
for only the hand of life can contain
your hearts.
and stand together yet not too near
together:
for the pillars of the temple stand apart,
and the oak tree and the cypress grow
not in each other’s shadow.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
then said almitra, speak to us of love.
and he raised his head and looked upon
the people, and there fell a stillness upon
them. and with a great voice he said:
when love beckons to you, follow him,
though his ways are hard and steep.
and when his wings enfold you yield to
him,
though the sword hidden among his
pinions may wound you.
and when he speaks to you believe in
him,
though his voice may shatter your dreams
as the north wind lays waste the garden. for even as love crowns you so shall he
crucify you. even as he is for your growth
so is he for your pruning.
even as he ascends to your height and
caresses your tenderest branches that quiver
in the sun,
so shall he descend to your roots and
shake them in their clinging to the earth.
like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto
himself.
he threshes you to make you naked.
he sifts you to free you from your husks.
he grinds you to whiteness.
he kneads you until you are pliant;
and then he assigns you to his sacred
fire, that you may become sacred bread for
god’s sacred feast. all these things shall love do unto you
that you may know the secrets of your
heart, and in that knowledge become a
fragment of life’s heart. but if in your fear you would seek only
love’s peace and love’s pleasure,
then it is better for you that you cover
your nakedness and pass out of love’s
threshing-floor,
into the seasonless world where you
shall laugh, but not all of your laughter,
and weep, but not all of your tears.
love gives naught but itself and takes
naught but from itself.
love possesses not nor would it be
possessed;
for love is sufficient unto love. when you love you should not say,
“god is in my heart,” but rather, “i am
in the heart of god.”
and think not you can direct the course
of love, for love, if it finds you worthy,
directs your course. love has no other desire but to fulfil
itself.
but if you love and must needs have
desires, let these be your desires:
to melt and be like a running brook
that sings its melody to the night.
to know the pain of too much tenderness.
to be wounded by your own under-
standing of love;
and to bleed willingly and joyfully.
to wake at dawn with a winged heart
and give thanks for another day of loving;
to rest at the noon hour and meditate
love’s ecstasy;
to return home at eventide with grati-
tude;
and then to sleep with a prayer for the
beloved in your heart and a song of praise
upon your lips.

there is big excitement in c block today.
on the window sill,
in a plastic ice cream cup
a little plant is growing.
this is all the men want to talk about:
how an apple seed germinated
in a crack of damp concrete;
how they tore open tea bags
to collect the leaves, leached them
in water, then laid the sprout onto the bed
made of lipton. how this finger of spring
dug one delicate root down
into the dark fannings and now
two small sleeves of green
are pushing out from the emerging tip.
the men are tipsy with this miracle.
each morning, one by one,
they go to the window and check
the progress of the struggling plant.
all through the day they return
to stand over the seedling
and whisper.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
when we got close enough
we could hear rivers inside the ice
heaving splits the groaning of a ledge
about to calve. strewn in the moraine
fresh moose sign—tawny oblong pellets
breaking up sharp black shale. in one breath
ice and air—history, the record
of breaking—prophecy, the warning
of what's yet to breakout from under
four stories of bone-crushing turquoise
retreating.

the door to the past is a strange door. it swings open and things pass through it, but they pass in one direction only. no man can return across that threshold, though he can look down still and see the green light waver in the weeds.
loren eiseley
a door opens in the wilderness.
people cross through it—bloused women families acquaintances friends all the ones i have loved
sleep-walkers night-walkers each dazed and shorn—street aurous with ice, a snowfall scratched into
moons—and everything i’d known—inside the bleak floating light of my lungs
in the capillaries of my eyes a blood glancing through the hatches—
if i said i would always be grateful if i lied or touched with spite
if night is just a foamline of shadows though we were both lost—the door
opening—the fear of being shown whole to the one who must love you still—
and stopped as if on a walk to say
look at that and what matters what really counts 
and i’ll tell you everything if you promise i promise i stood at door and behind me heard
snow-plows scrape against roads at the center of night—unknown to yourself 
and the word i said out-loud to no one that meant it was all to no purpose 
the word for the desire inside destruction for everything that can never be brought back—
loose snow blown hard to each bank and the common reel of those who
to avoid one extreme rush toward its opposite—snow blasted to piles—and never opened up to
anything that could reach me until you reached me—which hours belonged to us
when was i unknowingly alone why did you always return to walk here a path
behind my closed eyes shedding salt
dry snowfall and sticks—still were you here
with me i might say the moon rose in the casement window 
the red-haired boy across the street has learned to ride his bike
there are still picnics there are fountains and the world i am leaving behind says
one learns to see one learns to be kind—i closed my eyes i closed my hands
i shut down the fields in my arms the cattle on the plains veins ditches
blue ravines a gray bird sailing through a poplar brake kids
throwing snow i closed the last swinging juncos
sheep wool caught on barbed wire i closed
fumes and clear patches of sky i seized 
the river the town i shut down
the hard muscles of sleep farmlands
warming under midnight salt-lights scruff-pines
on the ridge animals scattering across slopes i closed
the smooth bone of evening a storm
on the hills white and noiseless spindled
prairies where i was born i shut i seized
the clouds i closed in anger—fervor—ardor
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
i came an errand one cloud-blowing evening
to a slab-built, black-paper-covered house
of one room and one window and one door,
the only dwelling in a waste cut over
a hundred square miles round it in the mountains:
and that not dwelt in now by men or women.
(it never had been dwelt in, though, by women,
so what is this i make a sorrow of?)
i came as census-taker to the waste
to count the people in it and found none,
none in the hundred miles, none in the house,
where i came last with some hope, but not much,
after hours’ overlooking from the cliffs
an emptiness flayed to the very stone.
i found no people that dared show themselves,
none not in hiding from the outward eye.
the time was autumn, but how anyone
could tell the time of year when every tree
that could have dropped a leaf was down itself
and nothing but the stump of it was left
now bringing out its rings in sugar of pitch;
and every tree up stood a rotting trunk
without a single leaf to spend on autumn,
or branch to whistle after what was spent.
perhaps the wind the more without the help
of breathing trees said something of the time
of year or day the way it swung a door
forever off the latch, as if rude men
passed in and slammed it shut each one behind him
for the next one to open for himself.
i counted nine i had no right to count
(but this was dreamy unofficial counting)
before i made the tenth across the threshold.
where was my supper? where was anyone’s?
no lamp was lit. nothing was on the table.
the stove was cold—the stove was off the chimney—
and down by one side where it lacked a leg.
the people that had loudly passed the door
were people to the ear but not the eye.
they were not on the table with their elbows.
they were not sleeping in the shelves of bunks.
i saw no men there and no bones of men there.
i armed myself against such bones as might be
with the pitch-blackened stub of an ax-handle
i picked up off the straw-dust covered floor.
not bones, but the ill-fitted window rattled.
the door was still because i held it shut
while i thought what to do that could be done—
about the house—about the people not there.
this house in one year fallen to decay
filled me with no less sorrow than the houses
fallen to ruin in ten thousand years
where asia wedges africa from europe.
nothing was left to do that i could see
unless to find that there was no one there
and declare to the cliffs too far for echo,
“the place is desert, and let whoso lurks
in silence, if in this he is aggrieved,
break silence now or be forever silent.
let him say why it should not be declared so.”
the melancholy of having to count souls
where they grow fewer and fewer every year
is extreme where they shrink to none at all.
it must be i want life to go on living.

why make so much of fragmentary blue
in here and there a bird, or butterfly,
or flower, or wearing-stone, or open eye,
when heaven presents in sheets the solid hue?
since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven (as yet)—
though some savants make earth include the sky;
and blue so far above us comes so high,
it only gives our wish for blue a whet.

the living come with grassy tread
to read the gravestones on the hill;
the graveyard draws the living still,
but never any more the dead.
the verses in it say and say:
‘the ones who living come today
to read the stones and go away
tomorrow dead will come to stay.’
so sure of death the marbles rhyme,
yet can’t help marking all the time
how no one dead will seem to come.
what is it men are shrinking from?
it would be easy to be clever
and tell the stones: men hate to die
and have stopped dying now forever.
i think they would believe the lie.

nature’s first green is gold,
her hardest hue to hold.
her early leaf’s a flower;
but only so an hour.
then leaf subsides to leaf.
so eden sank to grief,
so dawn goes down to day.
nothing gold can stay.

once when the snow of the year was beginning to fall,
we stopped by a mountain pasture to say, ‘whose colt?’
a little morgan had one forefoot on the wall,
the other curled at his breast. he dipped his head
and snorted at us. and then he had to bolt.
we heard the miniature thunder where he fled,
and we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and grey,
like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes.
‘i think the little fellow’s afraid of the snow.
he isn’t winter-broken. it isn’t play
with the little fellow at all. he’s running away.
i doubt if even his mother could tell him, “sakes,
it’s only weather.” he’d think she didn’t know!
where is his mother? he can’t be out alone.’
and now he comes again with a clatter of stone
and mounts the wall again with whited eyes
and all his tail that isn't hair up straight.
he shudders his coat as if to throw off flies.
‘whoever it is that leaves him out so late,
when other creatures have gone to stall and bin,
ought to be told to come and take him in.’

before man came to blow it right
the wind once blew itself untaught,
and did its loudest day and night
in any rough place where it caught. man came to tell it what was wrong:
it hadn’t found the place to blow;
it blew too hard—the aim was song.
and listen—how it ought to go! he took a little in his mouth,
and held it long enough for north
to be converted into south,
and then by measure blew it forth.by measure. it was word and note,
the wind the wind had meant to be—
a little through the lips and throat.
the aim was song—the wind could see.

they sent him back to her. the letter came
saying . . . and she could have him. and before
she could be sure there was no hidden ill
under the formal writing, he was there,
living. they gave him back to her alive—
how else? they are not known to send the dead—
and not disfigured visibly. his face?
his hands? she had to look, and ask,
‘what was it, dear?’ and she had given all
and still she had all—they had—they the lucky!
wasn’t she glad now? everything seemed won,
and all the rest for them permissible ease.
she had to ask, ‘what was it, dear?’
‘enough
yet not enough. a bullet through and through,
high in the breast. nothing but what good care
and medicine and rest, and you a week,
can cure me of to go again.’ the same
grim giving to do over for them both.
she dared no more than ask him with her eyes
how was it with him for a second trial.
and with his eyes he asked her not to ask.
they had given him back to her, but not to keep.

spades take up leaves
no better than spoons,
and bags full of leaves
are light as balloons. i make a great noise
of rustling all day
like rabbit and deer
running away. but the mountains i raise
elude my embrace,
flowing over my arms
and into my face. i may load and unload
again and again
till i fill the whole shed,
and what have i then? next to nothing for weight,
and since they grew duller
from contact with earth,
next to nothing for color. next to nothing for use,
but a crop is a crop,
and who’s to say where
the harvest shall stop?

the house had gone to bring again
to the midnight sky a sunset glow.
now the chimney was all of the house that stood,
like a pistil after the petals go. the barn opposed across the way,
that would have joined the house in flame
had it been the will of the wind, was left
to bear forsaken the place’s name.no more it opened with all one end
for teams that came by the stony road
to drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs
and brush the mow with the summer load. the birds that came to it through the air
at broken windows flew out and in,
their murmur more like the sigh we sigh
from too much dwelling on what has been. yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf,
and the aged elm, though touched with fire;
and the dry pump flung up an awkward arm;
and the fence post carried a strand of wire.
for them there was really nothing sad.
but though they rejoiced in the nest they kept,
one had to be versed in country things
not to believe the phoebes wept.

we did not want to be
unblessed, so we were blessed. long, thin wire, a little

hands. you want to tell me what went wrong? confusing
shapes across a wall, depression in the ground. the gorgeous
soldiers fought and fell. hie

that brave grave apart, our aperture: a heart
that has been ruptured absolutely by a passing god.

everything you thought you knew
must be relearned overnight. how to walk.
walk, not trip, over cords, 2x4s,
used coffee cups, concrete cores.
walk, 40 pounds on your shoulder, across
rebar or a wood plank; glide,
not wobble, not look like the bounce
beneath each bootstep scares you. how to dress yourself
to work outdoors all day midwinter
and keep warm, keep working, fingers moving;
or midsummer, with no hint of breasts. how to climb ladders–
not a step stool or a 4-footer–
ladders that stretch up two stories
where someone’s impatient
for that bundle of pipe. how to get coffee–
hot and how they like it–to a crew
spread out 10 floors; to carry muffins
three blocks in a paper sack
through sheets of rain. how to look.
to never go back empty-handed
when you’re told, grab me a this/that from the gangbox, if all you’ve done
is move things around, poke here and there;
if you haven’t emptied out the full contents
so the journeyman won’t shame you
by finding this/that in a quick minute,
after you’ve said, we don’t have any. how to be dependable
but not predictable-provokable.
not the lunch break entertainment. how to read
blueprints,
delivery orders,
the mood on the job;
how long it’s okay to sit down for coffee;
how early you can start rolling up cords. how to do well in school
from the back row
of a seats-assigned-jim-crow classroom
how to learn tricks-of-the-trade
from someone who does not like you. how to listen, to act-don’t-ask.
to duck when someone motions, duck! 
or when someone tells you, don’t talk to zeke,
to know what they mean
so you don’t even look
at zeke, the ironworker who’s always first out,
last in, standing there, so four times a day–
start, lunch, quit–all the workers walk past him,
like a sandbar, waves washing back and forth,
that catches debris. how to pick up the phone and call your friend,
the only one of the women not at class
the night the apprenticeship director met you all
at the door
carrying the nervous rumor
that one of the women had been raped
and you all look at each other
and it wasn’t any of you five. how to respond–within protocol–
when someone takes your ladder or tools,
imitates your voices on the loudspeaker,
spraypaints cunt on your baker staging,
urinates in your hardhat,
drives to your home
where you live alone
with your daughter
and keys your truck parked
in your own driveway. later, you’ll need the advanced skills:
how–without dislodging the keystone–
to humiliate a person, how to threaten
a person. deftly.
so no one’s certain for absolute
that’s what happened. not even you.

most near, most clear, and of the clearest bloom,
and of the fragrant mothers the most dear
and queen, and of diviner love the day
and flame and summer and sweet fire, no thread
of cloudy silver sprinkles in your gown
its venom of renown, and on your head
no crown is simpler than the simple hair. now of the music summoned by the birth
that separates us from the wind and sea,
yet leaves us in them, until earth becomes,
by being so much of the things we are,
gross effigy and simulacrum, none
gives motion to perfection more serene
than yours, out of our imperfections wrought,
most rare, or ever of more kindred air
in the laborious weaving that you wear. for so retentive of themselves are men
that music is intensest which proclaims
the near, the clear, and vaunts the clearest bloom,
and of all vigils musing the obscure,
that apprehends the most which sees and names,
as in your name, an image that is sure,
among the arrant spices of the sun,
o bough and bush and scented vine, in whom
we give ourselves our likest issuance. yet not too like, yet not so like to be
too near, too clear, saving a little to endow
our feigning with the strange unlike, whence
springs
the difference that heavenly pity brings.
for this, musician, in your girdle fixed
bear other perfumes. on your pale head wear
a band entwining, set with fatal stones.
unreal, give back to us what once you gave:
the imagination that we spurned and crave.

life contracts and death is expected,
as in a season of autumn.
the soldier falls. he does not become a three-days personage,
imposing his separation,
calling for pomp. death is absolute and without memorial,
as in a season of autumn,
when the wind stops, when the wind stops and, over the heavens,
the clouds go, nevertheless,
in their direction.

capitán profundo, capitán geloso,
ask us not to sing standing in the sun,
hairy-backed and hump-armed,
flat-ribbed and big-bagged.t here is no pith in music
except in something false. bellissimo, pomposo,
sing a song of serpent-kin,
necks among the thousand leaves,
tongues around the fruit.
sing in clownish boots
strapped and buckled bright. wear the breeches of a mask,
coat half-flare and half galloon;
wear a helmet without reason,
tufted, tilted, twirled, and twisted.
start the singing in a voice
rougher than a grinding shale. hang a feather by your eye,
nod and look a little sly.
this must be the vent of pity,
deeper than a truer ditty
of the real that wrenches,
of the quick that’s wry.

i was cold and leaned against the big oak tree
as if it were my mother wearing a rough apron
of bark, her upraised arms warning of danger.
through those boughs and leaves i saw
dark patches of sky. i thought a brooding
witch waited to catch me up from under
branches and take me, careening on her broom,
to her home in the jaundiced moon.
i looked to the roof of mom and dad's house
and wondered if the paisley couch patterns
would change during the day. my brother peeked
from a window and waved. when the bus came,
i pawed away from the trunk, fumbled,
and took my first step toward not returning.

my favorite is the cream puff lie,
the kind inflated with hot air,
expanded to make an heroic-sized story. another is the cannoli, a long lie,
well-packed with nutty details,
lightly wrapped in flakey truth. a macaroon isn't a little white lie,
but it's covered
with self-serving coconut. the apple tart carries slices
of sour gossip, only
slightly sweetened with truth. then there's the napoleon,
an iago lie of pernicious intent,
layer upon layer of dark deceit.

my lost sister used to try the trick
with the tablecloth, waiting until
the wine had been poured, the gravy boat filled,
before snapping the linen her ways mug as a matador, staring down
silver and crystal that would dare move,
paying no mind to the ancestor gloom
gliding across the wallpaper like clouds of a disapproving front—no hutch
or bureau spared, no lost sister sure
the trick would work this time, all those she loved
in another room, nibbling saltines, or in the kitchen, plating the last
of the roast beef. how amazed they would be
to be called to the mahogany room
for supper, to find something missing, something beautiful, finally, they could
never explain, the wine twittering
in its half-globes, candles aflutter, each
thing in its place, or so it seemed then, even though their lives had changed for good.

"a cradle thief," my mother called the man
we'd see in shops, cafes, parks, even church,
with "that poor girl" beside him. hand in hand,
they'd walk as if they didn't feel the scorch
of people's stares. the day we saw him press
his lips to hers, my mother blocked my eyes
as if his mouth (i longed for my first kiss)
against her mouth was smothering her cries.
all week, i ran a fever that wouldn't break.
"a cradle thief"—a voice i only half
knew as my own surprised me in the dark,
my sick-bed wet with shivers. "a cradle thief,"
i said again, as if the words could will
my window broken, footprint on the sill.

so it has come to this –
insomnia at 3:15 a.m.,
the clock tolling its enginelike a frog following
a sundial yet having an electric
seizure at the quarter hour. the business of words keeps me awake.
i am drinking cocoa,
the warm brown mama. i would like a simple life
yet all night i am laying
poems away in a long box.it is my immortality box,
my lay-away plan,
my coffin. all night dark wings
flopping in my heart.
each an ambition bird. the bird wants to be dropped
from a high place like tallahatchie bridge. he wants to light a kitchen match
and immolate himself. he wants to fly into the hand of michelangelo
and come out painted on a ceiling. he wants to pierce the hornet’s nest
and come out with a long godhead. he wants to take bread and wine
and bring forth a man happily floating in the caribbean. he wants to be pressed out like a key
so he can unlock the magi. he wants to take leave among strangers
passing out bits of his heart like hors d’oeuvres. he wants to die changing his clothes
and bolt for the sun like a diamond. he wants, i want.
dear god, wouldn’t it be
good enough just to drink cocoa? i must get a new bird
and a new immortality box.
there is folly enough inside this one.

when ice outside makes daggers of the grass,
i come to where the tides of life still flow.
the water here still moves behind the glass.in here, the seasons never seem to pass—
the sullen shark and rays still come and go.
outside the ice makes daggers of the grass and coats the roads. the meditative bass
won't puzzle how the blustery blizzards blow.
the water here still moves. behind the glass ,rose-tinted corals house a teeming mass
of busy neon creatures who don't know
"outside." the ice makes daggers of the grass and oily puddles into mirrors. gas
freezes in its lines; my car won't go,
but water here still moves behind the glass.no piles of valentines, no heart held fast—
just sea stars under lights kept soft and low.
outside, the ice makes daggers of the grass;
in here, the water moves behind the glass.

this sex is more than sex, under the will of the god of sex,
so i softly invoke transformation of your rueful image of haven
–those frozen rocks, that guilty lighthouse isolate from temptation–
to warm flemish landscape green and brighteyed with daisies of
dizzying color
where pilgrims are dancing after gospelling bird who sing of
new springs, good water.

i came here, being stricken, stumbling out
at last from streets; the sun, decreasing, took me
for days, the time being the last of autumn,
the thickets not yet stark, but quivering
with tiny colors, like some brush strokes in
the manner of the pointillists; small yellows
dart shaped, little reds in different pattern,
clicks and notches of color on threaded bushes,
a cracked and fluent heaven, and a brown earth.
i had these, and my food and sleep—enough. this is a countryside of roofless houses,—
taverns to rain,—doorsteps of millstones, lintels
leaning and delicate, foundations sprung to lilacs.
orchards where boughs like roots strike into the sky.
here i could well devise the journey to nothing,
at night getting down from the wagon by the black barns,
the zenith a point of darkness, breaking to bits,
showering motionless stars over the houses.
scenes relentless—the black and white grooves of a woodcut. but why the journey to nothing or any desire?
why the heart taken by even senseless adventure,
the goal a coffer of dust?
give my mouth to the air,
let arrogant pain lick my flesh with a tongue
rough as a cat’s; remember the smell of cold mornings,
the dried beauty of women, the exquisite skin
under the chins of young girls, young men’s rough beards,—
the cringing promise of this one, that one’s apology
for the knife struck down to the bone, gladioli in sick rooms,
asters and dahlias, flowers like ruches, rosettes. . .forever enough to part grass over the stones
by some brook or well, the lovely seed-shedding stalks;
to hear in the single wind diverse branches
repeating their sounds to the sky—that sky like scaled mackerel,
fleeing the fields—to be defended from silence,
to feel my body as arid, as safe as a twig
broken away from whatever growth could snare it
up to a spring, or hold it softly in summer
or beat it under in snow. i must get well.
walk on strong legs, leap the hurdles of sense, 
reason again, come back to my old patchwork logic,
addition, subtraction, money, clothes, clocks,
memories (freesias, smelling slightly of snow and of flesh
in a room with blue curtains) ambition, despair.
i must feel again who had given feeling over,
challenge laughter, take tears, play the piano,
form judgments, blame a crude world for disaster.to escape is nothing.
not to escape is nothing.
the farmer’s wife stands with a halo of darkness
rounding her head.
water drips in the kitchen
tapping the sink.
to-day the maples have split
limb from the trunk with the ice, a fresh wooden wound.
the vines are distorted with ice, ice burdens the breaking
roofs i have told you of.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
you have put your two hands upon me, and your mouth,
you have said my name as a prayer.
here where trees are planted by the water
i have watched your eyes, cleansed from regret,
and your lips, closed over all that love cannot say, my mother remembers the agony of her womb
and long years that seemed to promise more than this.
she says, “you do not love me,
you do not want me,
you will go away.” in the country whereto i go
i shall not see the face of my friend
nor her hair the color of sunburnt grasses;
together we shall not find
the land on whose hills bends the new moon
in air traversed of birds. what have i thought of love?
i have said, “it is beauty and sorrow.”
i have thought that it would bring me lost delights, and splendor
as a wind out of old time. . .but there is only the evening here,
and the sound of willows
now and again dipping their long oval leaves in the water.
<|endoftext|>

nothing was remembered, nothing forgotten.
when we awoke, wagons were passing on the warm summer pavements,
the window-sills were wet from rain in the night,
birds scattered and settled over chimneypots
as among grotesque trees. nothing was accepted, nothing looked beyond.
slight-voiced bells separated hour from hour,
the afternoon sifted coolness
and people drew together in streets becoming deserted.
there was a moon, and light in a shop-front,
and dusk falling like precipitous water. hand clasped hand
forehead still bowed to forehead—
nothing was lost, nothing possessed
there was no gift nor denial.2.
i have remembered you.
you were not the town visited once,
nor the road falling behind running feet. you were as awkward as flesh
and lighter than frost or ashes. you were the rind,
and the white-juiced apple,
the song, and the words waiting for music.3.
you have learned the beginning;
go from mine to the other.be together; eat, dance, despair,
sleep, be threatened, endure.
you will know the way of that. but at the end, be insolent;
be absurd—strike the thing short off;
be mad—only do not let talk
wear the bloom from silence. and go away without fire or lantern
let there be some uncertainty about your departure.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
now that i know
how passion warms little
of flesh in the mould,
and treasure is brittle,—i’ll lie here and learn
how, over their ground,
trees make a long shadow
and a light sound.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
i burned my life, that i might find
a passion wholly of the mind,
thought divorced from eye and bone,
ecstasy come to breath alone.
i broke my life, to seek relief
from the flawed light of love and grief. with mounting beat the utter fire
charred existence and desire.
it died low, ceased its sudden thresh.
i had found unmysterious flesh—
not the mind’s avid substance—still
passionate beyond the will.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
my voice, not being proud
like a strong woman’s, that cries
imperiously aloud
that death disarm her, lull her—
screams for no mourning color
laid menacingly, like fire,
over my long desire.
it will end, and leave no print.
as you lie, i shall lie:
separate, eased, and cured.
whatever is wasted or wanted
in this country of glass and flint
some garden will use, once planted.
as you lie alone, i shall lie,
o, in singleness assured,
deafened by mire and lime.
i remember, while there is time.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
love me because i am lost;
love me that i am undone.
that is brave,—no man has wished it,
not one.be strong, to look on my heart
as others look on my face.
love me,—i tell you that it is a ravaged
terrible place.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
you may have all things from me, save my breath,
the slight life in my throat will not give pause
for your love, nor your loss, nor any cause.
shall i be made a panderer to death,
dig the green ground for darkness underneath,
let the dust serve me, covering all that was
with all that will be? better, from time’s claws,
the hardened face under the subtle wreath. cooler than stones in wells, sweeter, more kind
than hot, perfidious words, my breathing moves
close to my plunging blood.
be strong, and hang
unriven mist over my breast and mind,
my breath! we shall forget the heart that loves,
though in my body beat its blade, and its fang.
i erred, when i thought loneliness the wide
scent of mown grass over forsaken fields,
or any shadow isolation yields.
loneliness was the heart within your side.
your thought, beyond my touch, was tilted air
ringed with as many borders as the wind.
how could i judge you gentle or unkind
when all bright flying space was in your care?
now that i leave you, i shall be made lonely
by simple empty days, never that chill
resonant heart to strike between my arms
again, as though distraught for distance,­–only
levels of evening, now, behind a hill,
or a late cock-crow from the darkening farms.
<|endoftext|>

since you would claim the sources of my thought recall the meshes whence it sprang unlimed, the reedy traps which other hands have timed to close upon it. conjure up the hot blaze that it cleared so cleanly, or the snow devised to strike it down. it will be free. whatever nets draw in to prison meat length your eyes must turn to watch it go.
my mouth, perhaps, may learn one thing too well, my body hear no echo save its own, yet will the desperate mind, maddened and proud, seek out the storm, escape the bitter spell that we obey, strain to the wind, be thrown straight to its freedom in the thunderous cloud.

the wind of night is mighty on the deep—
a presence haunting sea and land again.
that wind upon the watery waste hath been;
that wind upon the desert soon shall sweep.
o vast and mournful spirit, wherefore keep
thy vigil at the fleeting homes of men,
who need no voice of thine to tell them when
is come the hour to labor or to sleep? from waste to waste thou goest, and art dumb
before the morning. patient in her tree
the bird awaits until thy strength hath passed,
forgetting darkness when the day is come.
with other tidings hast thou burdened me,
whom desolations harbor at the last.

without how small, within how strangely vast!
what stars of terror had their path in thee!
what music of the heavens and the sea
lived in a sigh or thundered on the blast!
here swept the gleam and pageant of the past,
as beauty trembled to her fate’s decree;
here swords were forged for armies yet to be,
and tears were found too dreadful not to last. here stood the seats of judgment and its light,
to whose assizes all our dreams were led—
our best and worst, our paradise and hell;
and in this room delivered now to night,
the mortal put its question to the dead,
and worlds were weighed, and god’s deep shadow fell.
here an immortal river had its rise,
though dusty now the fountain whence it ran
so swift and beautiful with good to man.
here the foundation of an empire lies—
the ruins of a realm seen not with eyes,
that now the vision of a gnat could scan.
here wars were fought within a little span,
whose echoes yet resound on human skies.
life, on her rainbow road from dust to dust,
spilt here her wildest iris, still thine own,
master, and with thy soul and ashes one!
thy wings are distant from our years of lust,
yet he who liveth not by bread alone
shall see thee as that angel in the sun.

the ore before man’s labouring wisdom gave me birth
i had not even seen the light of day;
down in the central darkness of the earth,
crushed by the weight of continents i lay,
ground by the weight to heat, not knowing then
the air, the light, the noise, the world of men. the trees
we grew on mountains where the glaciers cry,
infinite sombre armies of us stood
below the snow-peaks which defy the sky;
a song like the gods moaning filled our wood;
we knew no men—our life was to stand staunch,
singing our song, against the avalanche. the hemp and flax we were a million grasses on the hill,
a million herbs which bowed as the wind blew,
trembling in every fibre, never still;
out of the summer earth sweet life we drew.
little blue-flowered grasses up the glen,
glad of the sun, what did we know of men? the workers we tore the iron from the mountain’s hold,
by blasting fires we smithied it to steel;
out of the shapeless stone we learned to mould
the sweeping bow, the rectilinear keel;
we hewed the pine to plank, we split the fir,
we pulled the myriad flax to fashion her. out of a million lives our knowledge came,
a million subtle craftsmen forged the means;
steam was our handmaid and our servant flame,
water our strength, all bowed to our machines.
out of the rock, the tree, the springing herb
we built this wandering beauty so superb.
the sailors we, who were born on earth and live by air,
make this thing pass across the fatal floor,
the speechless sea; alone we commune there
jesting with death, that ever open door.
sun, moon and stars are signs by which we drive
this wind-blown iron like a thing alive.
the ship i march across great waters like a queen,
i whom so many wisdoms helped to make;
over the uncruddled billows of seas green
i blanch the bubbled highway of my wake.
by me my wandering tenants clasp the hands,
and know the thoughts of men in other lands.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
as unto lighter strains a boy might turn
from where great altars burn
and music’s grave archangels tread the night,
so i, in seasons past,
loved not the bitter might
and merciless control
of thy bleak trumpets calling to the soul.
their consummating blast
held inspirations of affright,
as when a faun
hears mournful thunders roll
on breathless, wide transparencies of dawn.
nor would i hear
with thee, superb and clear
the indomitable laughter of the race;
nor would i face
clean truth, with her cold agates of the well,
nor with thee trace
her footprints passing upward to the snows,
but sought a phantom rose
and islands where the ghostly siren sings;
nor would i dwell
where star-forsaking wings
on mortal thresholds hide their mystery,
nor watch with thee
the light of heaven cast on common things. but now in dreams of day i see thee stand
a grey, great sentry on the encompassed wall
that fronts the night forever, in thy hand
a consecrated spear
to test the dragons of man's ancient fear
from secret gulfs that crawl—
a captain of that choral band
whose reverend faces, anxious of the dark,
yet undismayed
by rain of ruined worlds against the night,
turned evermore to hark
the music of god's silence, and were stayed
by something other than the reason’s light.
and i have seen thee as
an eagle, strong to pass
where tempest-shapen clouds go to and fro
and winds and noons have birth,
but whose regard is on the lands below
and wingless things of earth.
and yet not thine for long
the feignéd passion of the nightingale,
nor shards of haliotis, nor the song
of cymballed fountains hidden in the dale,
nor gardens where the feet of fragrance steal:
’twas thine the laying-on to feel
of tragic hands imperious and cold,
that grasping, led thee from the dreams of old,
making thee voyager
of seas within the cosmic solitude,
whose moons the long-familiar stars occlude,—
whose living sunsets stir
with visions of the timelessness we crave.
and thou didst ride a wave
that gathered solemn music to its breast,
and breaking, shook our strand with thought’s unrest,
till men far inland heard its mighty call
where the young mornings leap the world’s blue wall.
nature hath lonely voices at her heart
and some thou heardst, for at thine own
were chords beyond all art
that thrill but to the eternal undertone.
but not necessitous to thee
the dreams that were when arcady began
or paphos soared in iris from the sea;
for thou couldst guess
the rainbows hidden in the frustrate slime,
and sawst in crownless man
a titan scourged thro’ time
with pains and raptures of his loneliness.
and thou wast wanderer
in that dim house that is the human heart,
where thou didst roam apart,
seeing what pillars were
between its deep foundations and the sun,
what halls of dream undone,
what seraphs hold compassionate their wings
between the youth and bitterness of things,
ere all see clear
the gain in loss, the triumph in the tear.
time’s whitest loves lie radiant in thy song,
like starlight on an ocean, for thine own
was as a deathless lily grown
in paradise—ethereal and strong.
and to thine eyes
earth had no earth that held not haughty dust,
and seeds of future harvestings in trust,
and hidden azures of eventual skies.
yet hadst thou sharper strains,
even as the power determines us with pains,
and seeing harvests, sawst as well the chaff,
and seeing beauty, sawst her shames no less,
loosing the sweet,
high thunder of thy jovian laugh
on souls purblind in their self-righteousness.
o vision wide and keen!
which knew, untaught, that pains to joyance are
as night unto the star
that on the effacing dawn must burn unseen.
and thou didst know what meat
was torn to give us milk,
what countless worms made possible the silk
that robes the mind, what plan
drew as a bubble from old infamies
and fen-pools of the past
the shy and many-colored soul of man.
yea! thou hast seen the lees
in that rich cup we lift against the day,
seen the man-child at his disastrous play—
his shafts without a mark,
his fountains flowing downward to the dark,
his maiming and his bars,
then turned to see
his vatic shadow cast athwart the stars,
and his strange challenge to infinity. but who am i to speak,
far down the mountain, of its altar-peak,
or cross on feeble wings,
adventurous, the oceans in thy mind?
we of a wider day’s bewilderings
for very light seem blind,
and fearful of the gods our hands have formed.
some lift their eyes and seem
to see at last the lofty human scheme
fading and topping as a sunset stormed
by wind and evening, with the stars in doubt.
and some cry, “on to brotherhood!” and some
(their dream's high music dumb):“nay! let us hide in roses all our chains, tho’ all the lamps go out! let us accept our lords! time’s tensions move not save to subtler pains.” 
and over all the silence is as swords. …
wherefore be near us in our day of choice,
lest hell’s red choirs rejoice;
and may our counsels be
more wise, more kindly, for the thought of thee;
and may our deeds attest
thy covenant of fame
to men of after-years that see thy name
held like a flower by honor to her breast.
thy station in our hearts long since was won—
safe from the jealous years—
thou of whose love, thou of whose thews and tears
we rest most certain when the day is done
and formless shadows close upon the sun!
thou wast a star ere death’s long night shut down,
and for thy brows the crown
was graven ere the birth-pangs, and thy bed
is now of hallowed marble, and a fane
among the mightier dead:
more blameless than thine own what soul hath stood?
dost thou lie deaf until another reign,
or hear as music o’er thy head
the ceaseless trumpets of the war for good?
ah, thou! ah, thou!
stills god thy question now?

i saw the racer coming to the jump,
staring with fiery eyeballs as he rusht,
i heard the blood within his body thump,
i saw him launch, i heard the toppings crusht.
and as he landed i beheld his soul
kindle, because, in front, he saw the straight
with all its thousands roaring at the goal,
he laughed, he took the moment for his mate.
would that the passionate moods on which we ride
might kindle thus to oneness with the will;
would we might see the end to which we stride,
and feel, not strain in struggle, only thrill,
and laugh like him and know in all our nerves
beauty, the spirit, scattering dust and turves.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
here, in this darkened room of this old house,
i sit beside the fire.
i hear again,
within, the scutter where the mice carouse,
without, the gutter dropping with the rain.
opposite, are black shelves of wormy books,
to left, glazed cases, dusty with the same,
behind, a wall, with rusty guns on hooks,
to right, the fire, that chokes one panting flame.
over the mantel, black as funeral cloth,
a portrait hangs, a man, whose flesh the worm
has mawed this hundred years, whose clothes the moth
a century since, has channelled to a term.
i cannot see his face : i only know
he stares at me, that man of long ago. i light the candles in the long brass sticks,
i see him now, a pale-eyed, simpering man,
framed in carved wood, wherein the death-watch ticks,
a most dead face : yet when the work began
that face, the pale puce coat, the simpering smile,
the hands that hold a book, the eyes that gaze,
moved to the touch of mind a little while.
the painter sat in judgment on his ways :
the painter turned him to and from the light,
talked about art, or bade him lift his head.
judged the lips’ paleness and the temples’ white,
and now his work abides ; the man is dead.
but is he dead ? this dusty study drear
creaks in its panels that the man is here.
here, beyond doubt, he lived, in that old day.
“he was a doctor here,” the student thought.
here, when the puce was new, that now is grey,
that simpering man his daily practice wrought.
here he let blood, prescribed the pill and drop,
the leech, the diet ; here his verdict given
brought agonies of hoping to a stop,
here his condemned confessioners were shriven.
what is that book he holds, the key, too dim
to read, to know ; some little book he wrote,
forgotten now, but still the key to him.
he sacrificed his vision for his coat.
i see the man ; a simpering mask that hid
a seeing mind that simpering men forbid.
those are his books no doubt, untoucht, undusted,
unread, since last he left them on the shelves,
octavo sermons that the fox has rusted,
sides splitting off from brown decaying twelves.
this was his room, this darkness of old death,
this coffin-room with lights like embrasures,
the place is poisonous with him ; like a breath
on glass, he stains the spirit ; he endures.
here is his name within the sermon book,
and verse, “when hungry worms my body eat”;
he leans across my shoulder as i look,
he who is god or pasture to the wheat.
he who is dead is still upon the soul
a check, an inhibition, a control.
i draw the bolts.
i am alone within.
the moonlight through the coloured glass comes faint,
mottling the passage wall like human skin,
pale with the breathings left of withered paint.
but others walk the empty house with me,
there is no loneliness within these walls
no more than there is stillness in the sea
or silence in the eternal waterfalls.
there in the room, to right, they sit at feast ;
the dropping grey-beard with the cold blue eye,
the lad, his son, that should have been a priest,
and he, the rake, who made his mother die.
and he, the gambling man, who staked the throw,
they look me through, they follow when i go. 
they follow with still footing down the hall,
i know their souls, those fellow-tenants mine,
their shadows dim those colours on the wall,
they point my every gesture with a sign.
that grey-beard cast his aged servant forth
after his forty years of service done,
the gambler supped up riches as the north
sups with his death the glories of the sun.
the lad betrayed his trust ; the rake was he
who broke two women’s hearts to ease his own :
they nudge each other as they look at me,
shadows, all our, and yet as hard as stone.
and there, he comes, that simpering man, who sold
his mind for coat of puce and penny gold.
o ruinous house, within whose corridors
none but the wicked and the mad go free.
(on the dark stairs they wait, behind the doors
they crouch, they watch, or creep to follow me.)
deep in old blood your ominous bricks are red,
firm in old bones your walls’ foundations stand,
with dead men’s passions built upon the dead,
with broken hearts for lime and oaths for sand.
terrible house, whose horror i have built,
sin after sin, unseen, as sand that slips
telling the time, till now the heaped guilt
cries, and the planets circle to eclipse.
you only are the daunter, you alone
clutch, till i feel your ivy on the bone.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
before the unseen cock had called the time,
those workers left their beds and stumbled out
into the street, where dust lay white as lime
under the last star that keeps bats about.
then blinking still from bed, they trod the street,
the doors closed up and down ; the traveller heard
doors opened, closed, then silence, then men’s feet
moving to toil, the men too drowsed for word.
the bean-field was a greyness as they passed,
the darkness of the hedge was starred with flowers,
the moth, with wings like dead leaves, sucked his last,
the triumphing cock cried out with all his powers ;
his fire of crying made the twilight quick,
then clink, clink, clink, men’s trowels tapped the brick.
i saw the delicate man who built the tower
look from the turret at the ground below,
the granite column wavered like a flower,
but stood in air whatever winds might blow.
its roots were in the rock, its head stood proud,
no earthly forest reared a head so high ;
sometimes the eagle came there, sometimes cloud,
it was man’s ultimate footstep to the sky.
and in that peak the builder kept his treasure,
books with the symbols of his art, the signs
of knowledge in excitement, skill in pleasure,
the edge that cut, the rule that kept the lines.
he who had seen his tower beneath the grass,
rock in the earth, now smiled, because it was.
how many thousand men had done his will, 
men who had hands, or arms, or strength to spend,
or cunning with machines, or art, or skill !
all had obeyed him, working to this end.
hundreds in distant lands had given their share
of power, to deck it; on its every stone
their oddity of pleasure was laid bare,
yet was the tower his offspring, his alone.
his inner eye had seen, his will had made it,
all the opposing army of men’s minds
had bowed, had turned, had striven as he bade it,
each to his purpose in their myriad kinds.
now it was done, and in the peak he stood
seeing his work, and smiled to find it good.it had been stone, earth’s body, hidden deep,
lightless and shapeless, where it cooled and hardened.
now it was as the banner on man’s keep
or as the apple in eden where god gardened.
lilies of stone ran round it, and like fires
the tongues of crockets shot from it and paused,
horsemen who raced were carven on’t, the spires
were bright with gold ; all this the builder caused.
and standing there, it seemed that all the hive
of human skill which now it had become,
was stone no more, nor building, but alive,
trying to speak, this tower that was dumb,
trying to speak, nay, speaking, soul to soul
with powers who are, to raven or control

part of suffering is the useless urge to announce that you’re suffering.
there is no other way to say it: i’m suffering. just to say “i suffer”
helps. i read somewhere, “we become lyrical when we suffer.” happiness is suffering for the right reasons. first-order suffering is second-order happiness. you have to suffer for beauty? because you have to suffer. we pride ourselves on a high quality of suffering. turgenev was born in 1818 in the province of orel, and suffered
during his childhood from a tyrannical mother.in the past their suffering was less absurd. the problem is, everything’s worse. like, paper or plastic? we’re all
still going to die suffering. i value being alone with my thoughts, but it’s weird to say, “this
thing that makes us suffer less, we have to stop doing it.” isn’t it kind of the point of culture to assuage our feeling needless
and alone? how does one suffer “gladly,” exactly? at least the rich get to suffer in comfort.it makes the life feel longer. live to suffer another day. one’s past suffering can be a great source of comfort. a torturous
luxury. velvet upholstery. suffering is happiness, after forty minutes of desolate shuffling. the
point is, life is suffering. about suffering, no one is ever wrong.

growing into ourselves
earnest and funny we were
angels of some kind, smiling visitors
the light we lived in was gorgeous
we looked up and into the camera
the ordinary things we did with our hands
or how we turned and walked
or looked back we lifted the child
spooned food into his mouth
the camera held it, stayed it
there we are in our lives as if
we had all time
as if we would stand in that room
and wear that shirt those glasses
as if that light
without end
would shine on us
and from us.

first day of february,
and in the far corner of the yard
the adirondack chair,
blown over by the wind at christmas,
is still on its back,
the snow too deep for me
to traipse out and right it,
the ice too sheer
to risk slamming these old bones
to the ground.
in a hospital bed in her room
where her bed used to be,
and her husband,
my aunt millie keeps reaching up
for the far corner of the room,
whispering that is so interesting. i will go now.
in april
i will walk out
across the warming grass,
and right the chair
as if there had never been anything
to stop me in the first place,
listening for the buzz of hummingbirds
which reminds me of how fast
things are capable of moving.

abandoned house roofless three walls
no floor a ruin if you think house—to brown towhees a place to scratch
in the leaves for bugs and worms, for the male to sing a territorial song
from what remains of the chimney—an imagination problem like the time
friends said we must be very happy in the beautiful house we built because
they couldn't see the ruins inside us.

where in the world
does my mother go, eyes
shut so tight her lower lashes
curl in toward a view
that's hers alone?
yesterday she told
me—after the rains, the winds came, and this morning
that's what they do.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
the storm was headed in our direction—
big loom of gray like the absolute west
leaned over us. reports of damage
in the neighboring counties—a silo unfurled
and took wing, a house trailer
twisted loose. on the doppler screen
the storm looked alive, yellow and green
at the fringes, with a fierce red heart
trending to violet. sirens swept over
to scare it away, like songbirds
grow strident, circle and bluff
at the sight of an owl.
when the rain came in sheets,
i regretted my sins. when lightning
cracked the red pine's half-rotted heart,
i wished the world more joy
in general. when the worst was over
and the grass lay flat, but alive,
and the sky was a waning bruise,
i thought of that silo, how it wasn't mine,
and all that grain cast back into the world's
wind, maybe some of it still flying.

the unknown has hold of me and its grip is strong as honey on the underside of a spoon the unknown i mean is not the usual one the future the tomorrow of survival but the past and what happened in the name of the name after mine and in the name of the name before mine
i do not know enough to speak i do not know enough to remain silent there is a fear that holds me and it sounds like wind it sounds like katydids in catalpaah the tall grass of the days before i knew there was a before me
where do i live if there’s no home remaining where do i live if the home i helped build can never be mine and the one i was born into never was

in zero cold the engine's slow
to turn over, coughing
awake like my father sitting on the edge
of the bed staring at the blue linoleum floor,
coughing again, lifting his heavy body
into another day on the railroad section gang,
the icy wind through lehigh gap blasting
down on him as he raises the sledge hammer
and strains against the crowbar.
but now he's drinking coffee,
looking toward the dark window,
thinking of what?
maybe watching friday night fights
or ordering tomato seeds,
maybe the ghostly face in the window
staring back at him.

a bed sheet hung out to dry
became a screen for shadow animals.
but of all laundry days in the neighborhood
the windy ones were best,
the clothespins like little men riding
lines that tried to buck them off.
one at a time we ran down the aisles
between snapping sheets
that wanted to put us in our place.
timing them, you faked and cut
like famous halfbacks. but if a sheet
tagged you it put you down, pinned
by the whiteness floating
against a sky washed by the bluing
our mothers added to the wash water.
could anyone make it through those days
untouched? you waited for
your chance, then jumped up and finished
the course, rising if you fell again.
later, let the sky darken suddenly
and we'd be sent out to empty the lines.
all up and down the block, kids
running with bed sheets in their arms,
running like firemen rescuing children.
all night those sheets lay draped
over furniture, as though we were leaving
and would not return for a long time.

more a product of misspent music
halted at the border
flicking seeds sent
through a blister in the wall
i plant movements

through a crack in the planet
where monkeys sink into
a song their fathers grew
on filaments of language
& certain birds
are mad to hunt a spectrum
of only one meaning
where handmade clouds sound
free from ligament
released beyond bounds
offering steam to relax gem
i can float here combing my hair into waterfall
i am a human fly
wings slick with telepathic goo
an archive of earth piled on my back
this is theater ...
so please assume the role of curtain
i am the director of this fuzz
a tardy imago: the result of clandestine flare
when we returned to your house
we noticed that it wasn’t there
so we built a human pyramid
without flesh
without internal radar or private song
a formation known to drain the color of black suns
and toward this stone we lean
where birds are higher
than sapphire mammatus
where we speak of things mouth-less, bare

hands over her heart,

i rocked in a chair of charred grand dragon’s bones,
legs silent as molasses drooling from a cloud of linen.
my fat white maid in her potholder hat
did not watch me watch her sons
molt like dandelions in la-di-da noon
standing squarely on the blacks of their own shadows as they willed.
she crushed lemons in her bear claw fists
and pushed a sugar dust around the pitcher.
the mister started in on the mare,
phantasm of a centaur where it splinters.
three latticed glasses harmonized on the platter:
my quiet kindness to the albess
for where i sent her daughter.
it was saturday. there was salt in his seams
and the slip between my knees slumped with heat
and sheets jedidiah-teething the clothesline already.
followed hours full of our trying to be full of each other
and sunlight yearning like egg white through
the cracked curtains
and the usual evidence of bluegrass his shoulders shed
beneath my nails, the rooms in me he could not enter
branching annexes: my elderberry privacies.
out of the yard’s farthest hem, darkness
from the world’s first days braided into the tobacco
and i could only imagine tomorrow
if i expected to be slaughtered in my sleep.

all my life i’ve asked my master
why i am unable to choose
this sweet man or fancy shoes
over this stranger, more difficult lover
and these expensive but practical loafers
and why i am unable to author
a book exhibiting my full potential
and have focused instead on inconsequential
letters to strange and difficult lovers
who by my letters were never changed.
i certainly haven’t been constrained
by terrible parents or trauma or poverty
and even if i had it wouldn’t explain
my propensity for misery
anymore than it would my
propensity for joy.
maybe i’m just a procrastinator
as life is a procrastination of death
and each breath just a procrastination of breath
and friends a procrastination of work
and work a procrastination of love
and love a procrastination i’m just not above.

polish your silver
try a new flavor of yogurt
burn in a lake of fire
smoke some weed
overeat
finally understand some things
talk to steve
cry out breathlessly
pay the electric bill
go to the aquarium in the mall
worry over the shape and color of your moles
sell out the people you used to call friends
learn how to bake bread
feed the ducks at the lake by the highway
exaggerate your earnings
get elected
mull things over
attend a livestock auction
pull down the statues of people who tortured your ancestors
seek employment
knit
regret mostly everything
paint the windows shut
pull down the statues of your ancestors
get down on your knees
read kierkegaard
pick the kids up from montessori
lose your appetite
linger
imagine that hell is only an abstraction
dvr homeland
take another free breath mint
cry out endlessly
blame those closest to you
love even the barest light pissing through the trees

the commentator's rabbiting on and on
about how it's so easy for roger, resentment
thick as butter still in a box. yet word
from those who've done their homework
is how the man loves to train—how much
he relishes putting in the hours
just as magicians shuffle card after card,
countless to mere humans
but carefully all accounted for.
at hearing "luck" again, i stop
until my hands relax their clutch
on the cone from which a dozen more
peonies are to materialize. i make it look easy
to grow a garden on top of a sheet
of fondant, and that's how it should appear:
as natural and as meant-to-be
as the spin of a ball from the sweetest spot
of a racquet whisked through the air like a wand.

the stone dolls, found in an egyptian tomb,
are eyeless, armless, heavy for a child
to hold. not like the dolls that lined the room
my sister and i shared, their bodies light
and made for being bent, their eyelids mobile,
hair that tangled with our own. "at night,"
our father winked at us, "they come to life."
we never pressed our cheeks against cold stone
as pharoah's daughters did. the doctor's knife
could not have caught my sister more off-guard
or left me less alone; i had my dolls.
though, soon, they lay on tables in the yard
with price tags. even then they looked alive,
survivors with no sickness to survive.

when they entered the house, which was a very large house
the way a cloud is large, the pages of their story
seemed like cracks in the earth, a man's shirt, or a woman's
blouse, and the stranger in the house told them to make
themselves at home in the house that was not their house,
and told them to write down the three most important gifts
in each of their lives, and then continued to explain how
there were three doors in the house and at each door they must
forfeit one of these gifts, and how the real story always begins
at the third door, where each of them will pause and begin
to crawl, leaving the field of time, where now you pause,
touching the door of this page, wiping away each word, waiting to enter.

even now it idles outside the houses
where we failed to get better at piano lessons,
visits the parking lot of the ballet school
where my sister and i stood awkwardly
at the back. my mother's van was orange
with a door we slid open to reveal
beheaded plastic dragons and bunches
of black, half-eaten bananas; it was where
her sketchbooks tarried among
abandoned coffee cups ands cience projects. she meant to go places
in it: camp in its back seat
and cook on its stove while painting the coast of nova scotia,
or capturing the cold beauty of the blue ridge
mountains at dawn. instead, she waited
behind its wheel while we scraped violins, made digestive sounds
with trumpets, danced badly at recitals
where grandmothers recorded us with unsteady cameras. sometimes, now,
i look out a window and believe i see it,
see her, waiting for me beside a curb, under a tree, and i think i could open the door,
clear off a seat, look at the drawing in her lap,
which she began, but never seemed to finish.

i sit with my thermos of coffee on the mall:
a mile-long promenade, arcades of elms
flanking a generous aliquot of benches. but at this early hour it starts to dawn:
i am the only one without a dog.
so, a witness to an ancient symbiosis,
as it's evolved within a modern city: the dogs, i note, are smaller, the owners
less ferocious. the former sniff then poop,
the latter, like potty-training parents, pat their heads,
gather it in plastic doggy-bags. it's no longer for the hunt or for protection;
both species have adapted to survive
hard loneliness inside a small apartment.

somewhere recently
i lost my short-term memory.
it was there and then it moved
like the flash of a red fox
along a line fence.my short-term memory
has no address but here
no time but now.
it is a straight-man, waiting to speak
to fill in empty space
with name, date, trivia, punch line.
and then it fails to show.it is lost, hiding somewhere out back
a dried ragweed stalk on the kansas prairie
holding the shadow of its life
against a january wind. how am i to go on?
i wake up a hundred times a day.
who am i waiting for
what am i looking for
why do i have this empty cup
on the porch or in the yard?
i greet my neighbor, who smiles.
i turn a slow, lazy susan
in my mind, looking for
some clue, anything to break the spell
of being lost in plain sight.

“i’m interested in feminist oratory,” we think
jess should say
“specifically that.” yellow-breasted engine sounds on the
joshua tree
joshua tree mid-shimmy i think every bird is mad
at me. does that make me
an alcoholic? let’s take a break, after
the great san bernardino sculpture party sparkling toilet pieces lay tiled into
the pavilion,
silver flushers too.tv piles. i am
uneasy. so what?
no match for the always sand and always air. i find a pair of leather pants
hanging in a hut & touch them.
definitely not leather. i can see the sunscreen on your face
not rubbed in,
rivulets wet the under-chin. let’s get this next pitch

i find the heavens beautiful,
i find the earth so too,
the seas and the ground,
the furling of water and gas,
the bright distant points
of our isolation. i take comfort
in the swinging pendant traffic lights,
the slurry of wet raw flour.
i am programmed to this language,
and can only voice my rejection of it
in the same language.
this is the power of diaspora,
the difficulty in finding alternative.
let us send messages to the half-existent.
to excuse oneself, to claim not knowing
the future, is inhuman. i am so worthless
that my body serves as brick,
conscripted to build up my prison
until it is time to lay my own body
down for the walls. it is mechanical,
snipping into the loop of every lace,
separating from every link
the cold wrapped bud. at first the skin
is thick and bright,
then darkly collapses.
nothing keeps its shape,
nothing stands itself upright,
we keep sliding apart into smaller
and smaller components, and it is
in the air above us now,
we do not mingle with the outcome
of ideas any longer, the energy
that knows whether cruelty
is disinterested or rightful.
they are so happy
while we laugh at them,
their eyes enthused and shining
while we trick them
into hurting themselves.

you’re leaving las vegas, except

you made me cum like that -
she got so mad in the bed - the

the bathtub, the apartment where
i was the crying queen those o’s still unforgettable

wasn’t about the cum shot

i can’t take that kind of cold. i’m leaving las vegas.
just a moon in taurus trying
to sing the sweet and
it’s not a great user experience but i just want you to know
how unforgettable you are when the candles call to hera
i hope they melt your
i hope a goddess or many
wash that loneliness away
and when i see you again (in 15 years)
there’s only joy and more i prefer you laughing to tears
the good way. drink us when
we’re done. well, i guess i did
almost kill you with a
razor shave once so it
seems silly to say i’m sorry i
lost the phantom thread.
maybe everything’s a ridiculous
never-ending non-planet
tho, u did kiss me like unicorns
exist and bond our skin
like the organ it deserves to be
known as to know how unforgettable
you are because there
lies the bridge to the
mainland. & baby, you
deserve it all.

i wait and wonder
what i’d do
if someone said pick your 60 best poems.
pick all of them? or any?
maybe commit suicide, but everyone would say
“it’s because he’s really gay,” or maybe
“really not gay.” read anne waldman and terence winch,
bruce andrews and adrienne rich, wonder what might happen
to me this summer if i go away, or stay here in washington dc
where you can see watergate live!
*if you want to know the truth today’s my birthday
and though i often feel older, and sometimes appear younger
i’m 31, and like everything else that too can be fun
or a bummer, a drain on the cosmic energy, depending on what?
if you know the answer you win the future;
if you don’t the future is ours to lose or—
whatever happened to the old way of construction?
well, one line still follows another, and my voices moves
between each space, and when i think of you i sweat,
or maybe just imagine myself like a cartoon troublemaker
big beads of perspiration jumping out from my skin as i
cringe behind the fence that the bully is about to
throw a bomb over, or drop an anvil over, or just put his
meaty fist through and right on into my scared shitless grin,
the analogy resting on our mutual vulnerability—
that’s poetry isn’t it?
*of course i don’t talk like this.
i talk like this.*
and now it’s time to go back to the history of rock’n’roll
which means it’s my night to cook dinner for “the house”—
collective—and it’s gonna be smoked sausage cooked in peppers
and mushrooms and carrots, maybe some onions, and beans
for protein, or something nutritional. i picked the sausage
because it seemed to be looking at me in the safeway,
not exactly the way i was looking at one of the cashiers,
a young man with curly blonde hair and nice build
who seemed to have a down home kind of friendliness,
or the woman with the little girl the same sizes as miles,
who is a little smaller than caitlin, both of whom were
pulling on my pants leg for pennies for gumballs as i watched
the curve of the woman’s arm as she placed each
well thought over item on the counter behind my
vibrational buying and didn’t even notice how much i fell in love
with her arm and felt guilty for objectifying a part of her
although she might all be like her arm and then i might
fall in love with all of her, but that would cause problems,
she probably is already in love with at least one person, and
i’m already in love with about fourteen on a regular basis, and
that keeps causing all kinds of problems because people who are
attracted to my style don’t like my ways—that sounded like
a pretentious folk singing prodigy’s idea of an early dylan line,
but what i meant would never be explained right in a poem like this,
or one like anne waldman’s either though i like to read hers
because they make me want to write, and in my world that’s what
“great” writers are supposed to do–make everyone else, or
at least me, feel like i can write too, and then make me feel,
like i will, and then i do.
*after dinner we’ll eat the cake atticus made for my birthday
there’ll be some presents from some of the people in the house, and
maybe annie will stop over, or matthew might call from work, or we
might all go down to watch him make salads at
food for thought,
and maybe eat some too, all along getting stoned on the house doobie,
which goes too fast these days but never fast enough, which is
about the way i feel on my birthday about my life, either that or
the way i’m easily satisfied but never feel i can get too much–
sometimes everything is enough, you know?
*happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me,
i think i just heard chuck come in, caitlin’s
angry with me and throwing a tantrum in
her room, it’s raining but i hear the dishes
being done finally by someone else
happy birthday to me*
resolution: no more guilt trips
from outside or inside
going either direction
–is everybody happy?

there’s coffee and pie
with a widow from church.
why do you sit
in the back pew? she asks.
i’m close enough, i say.
can i sit back there with you?
i’ve always sat there, i tell her,
with my same two friends,
and their clicking oxygen pumps.
one sat next to me for years,
called herself my church girlfriend,
who metastasized, telling me she was
tired of waiting to die.
now, there’s just my 88-year-old friend,
his pump echoing in the sanctuary,
and there’s that empty
space between us.
i’d like to invite the widow to sit there,
but i miss my dead friend’s laugh,
her loving stories about her husband,
and how we were always
glad to see one another.
i tell the widow all this.
what if i just sat there? she asks.
it’s a free country, i tell her,
and she smiles.

in the pink light,
haloes of cloud form over the mountains;
lightning, two valleys away,
then, not an hour later, the explosion of thunder.
the roadrunners
pecking for breadcrumbs on the porch
have long since fled into the rabbitbrush, into the endless ocean of grass.
driving in every direction
down licks of red road, i have lost
myself in a militarized topography; everything named after army units,
generals, scouts, miners…the dragoon mountains, cochise stronghold; defunct
gleeson and pearce,
weird, rusty ghost towns, the only
non-derelict structure
for miles, the local school, its polished windows and well-kept lawn,
a source of great local pride.
no mountain monograms
for these desiccated whistle-stops, no giant q or c or w in bright
white paint to mark
the township's still functional
sorta functional breathing, no carving for them
into the planet's bark;
and thus they are blesséd
to me like no other; every successful city
is a flimsy affair with civility,
its eternalness, like paris or rome,
mere hypocrisy. make america great again,
buy real estate! hail follows rain.
nearby, the township of sunsites,
once billed as the safestspot to survive
the inevitable nuclear winter,
actually topped soviet russia's
list of high-priority targets… enter the orange duck candidate.
a haboob sweeps across
the valley of the senile.
in a week, the mountains have switched from brown
to purple to green.
the desert is human
endeavour's most fitting graveyard; the slow bleaching,
the gradual eroding into sand,
the heat stifling sound as it leaps into the air.

we must have known,
even as we reached
down to touch them
where we'd found them shut-eyed and trembling
under a straw bale
in the haymow, that
she would move them that night under cover
of darkness, and that
by finding them
we were making certain we wouldn't see them again
until we saw them
crouching under the pickup
like sullen teens, having gone as wild by then as they'd gone
still in her mouth that night
she made a decision
any mother might make upon guessing the intentions
of the state: to go and to
go now, taking everything
you love between your teeth.

is walking around boston
common. he’s young.
it’s winter. emerson

and talk for hours, or really

whitman for slavering
after tree knots and bobbing
with the swimmer. whitman nods
but in his head he’s busy
tallying his orgasms.
at the carousel
an ancient puritan is passing
his hat, singing, “kill it babe.”
dozens of geese have gathered
on the frozen pond,
standing on one leg,
tucking the other like a dagger

well, emerson asks the poet,
what do you have to say for yourself?
and whitman, respectfully,

all the way down in his bones
where the deep, frontier feeling
of disobedience lives, says,
essentially, go fuck yourself.

give up sitting dutifully at your desk. leave
your house or apartment. go out into the world. it's all right to carry a notebook but a cheap
one is best, with pages the color of weak tea
and on the front a kitten or a space ship. avoid any enclosed space where more than
three people are wearing turtlenecks. beware
any snow-covered chalet with deer tracks
across the muffled tennis courts. not surprisingly, libraries are a good place to write.
and the perfect place in a library is near an aisle
where a child a year or two old is playing as his
mother browses the ranks of the dead. often he will pull books from the bottom shelf.
the title, the author's name, the brooding photo
on the flap mean nothing. red book on black, gray
book on brown, he builds a tower. and the higher
it gets, the wider he grins. you who asked for advice, listen: when the tower
falls, be like that child. laugh so loud everybody
in the world frowns and says, "shhhh." then start again.

i gather her head up in my sweater
and we crouch here 
some dried ketchup where her lip turns down
a light crust of dirt on one eyebrow
the concrete stained and worn
surprise rain splattered in the gap
between here and the parking lot
our socks are wet our feet itch
then her cough started 
it’s going to be ok we can hide her for a minute
her damp head soaks the wool
the corners reek of urine
we do a sober trick
my body now a cradle
her hair touches my wrist she trembles down to her cavity
a cough we love
the careless future emerges from it
shaking like a star bracelet with elastic
in this other country
the contradictory music of our tears what do wandering souls find
to live in here
what warm skin in this stairwell
the air is cold the earth moves
one bug survives beyond their law three of us hunched
up like a heaps of wet wool
in the leaky crook of a stair you heard about us somewhere

in the grassy space between the wings of the elementary school and the trailers housing the fifth grade’s overflow classrooms, girls flip their hair in imitation of cindy crawford, sing iko iko. none of you know what it means or where the song comes from.
it’s honor-roll season, a time of outings to tcby and outback steakhouse. your mother warns you against filling up on bread, but it’s hard to resist the little brown loaves brought warm to the table with soft butter – a luxury that cannot be imagined at home, with its always-refrigerated margarine and pepperidge farm sandwich loaves.
everyone knows what’s popular but nobody knows how to act. at ten, you lack any context. the world swims before you, and it constantly stings. its favorite barb: “everybody knows that.”
beyond the grassy space of girls is more grass, a quarter-mile loop of track, a church with a painfully white spire, a fence, and a neighborhood maybe a little less nice than yours, crammed between the school and busy great neck road. the fence is of chain link, instead of wooden slats. that’s how you know about the niceness – that and the something hard, like a grain of sand, you feel in your mother’s voice, when she takes you to the school’s spring fling, where you win another goldfish. they always die, but you’re getting better. now, it takes a while. loblollies shiverin may heat. the world’s ending. the world’s a mirage.

at the 100-year-old national elk refuge
near jackson hole, we might ask, how long does an elk live? who’s an old elk here? we’d like to spend time
with an elder elk please.
tell us how to balance our lives
on this hard edge of human mean,
mean temperatures, what we do and don’t
want to mean. closing the door
to the news will only make you
stupid, snapped my friend
who wanted everyone to know as much
as she did. i’m hiding in old school books
with information we never used yet.
before i drove, before i flew,
before the principal went to jail.
sinking my eyes into tall wooden
window sashes, dreaming of light
arriving from far reaches,
our teacher as shepherds,
school a vessel of golden hope,
you could lift your daily lesson
in front of your eyes,
stare hard and think,
this will take me
somewhere. o histories of india,
geological formations of australia,
ancient poetries of china, japan,
someday we will be aligned in a place
of wisdom, together. red deer, wapiti, running elk rising
above yellow meadows at sundown.
an elk bows her head. in the company
of other elk, she feels at home.
and we are lost on the horizon now,
clumsy humanity,
deeper into the next century than we
can even believe,
and they will not speak to us.
<|endoftext|>

will tell us what she sees. document the moves, the dust,
soldiers blocking the road. yes, she knows how to take a picture
with her phone. holds it high like a balloon. yes, she would
prefer to dance and play, would prefer the world
to be pink. it is her job to say what she sees, what is happening.
from her vantage point everything is huge—but don’t look down on her.
she’s bigger than you are. if you stomp her garden
each leaf expands its view. don’t hide what you do.
she sees you at 2 a.m. adjusting your impenetrable vest.
what could she have that you want? her treasures,
thing shiny buttons her grandmother loved. her cousin, her uncle. there might have been a shirt. . .the tiny journalist notices
action on far away roads farther even than the next village.
she takes counsel from bugs so puffs of dust find her first. could that be a friend? 
they pretended not to see us. they came at night with weapons. 
what was our crime? that we liked respect as they do? that we have pride? she stares through a hole in the fence,
barricade of words and wire, feels the rising fire
before anyone strikes a match. she has a better idea.

when people have a lot
they want more when people have nothing
they will happily share it
some people say
never getting your way

by now our character must be
deep and wide as a continent
africa, australia
giant cascade of stars
spilling over our huge night
where did the power go?
did it enjoy its break?
is power exhausted?
what is real power?
who really has power?
did the generator break?
do we imagine silence
more powerful because
it might contain everything?
quiet always lives
inside noise.
but does it get much done?*silence waits
for truth to break it*calendars can weep too
they want us to have better days*welcome to every minute
feel lucky you’re still in it*no bird builds a wall*sky purse
jingling
change*won’t give up
our hopes
for anything!*not your fault
you didn’t make the world*how dare this go on and on?
cried the person who believed in praying
god willing
god willing god willing
there were others who prayed
to ruins & stumps
open palms
hold more
refuse to give
mistakes
too much power
annoying person?
person who told me to stay home
and do what other girls do?
if you disappeared
i still might miss you
babies want to help us
they laugh
for no reason
pay close attention to
a drop of water
on the kitchen table
you cannot say one word about religion
and exclude ahmad

each day i miss japanese precision. trying to arrange things
the way they would. i miss the call to prayer
at sharjah, the large collective pause. or
the shy strawberry vendor with rickety wooden cart,
single small lightbulb pointed at a mound of berries.
in one of china’s great cities, before dawn. forever i miss my arab father’s way with mint leaves
floating in a cup of sugared tea—his delicate hands
arranging rinsed figs on a plate. what have we here?
said the wolf in the children’s story
stumbling upon people doing kind, small things.
is this small monster one of us? when your country does not feel cozy, what do you do?
teresa walks more now, to feel closer to her
ground. if destination within two miles, she must
hike or take the bus. carries apples,
extra bottles of chilled water to give away.
kim makes one positive move a day for someone else.
i’m reading letters the ancestors wrote after arriving
in the land of freedom, words in perfect english script. . .
describing gifts they gave one another for christmas.
even the listing seems oddly civilized,
these 1906 germans. . . hand-stitched embroideries for dressertops. bow ties. slippers, parlor croquet, gold ring, “prettyinkwell.” how they comforted themselves! a giant roast
made them feel more at home.
posthumous medals of honor for
coming, continuing––could we do that?
and where would we go?
my father’s hope for palestine
stitching my bones, “no one wakes up and
dreams of fighting around the house”—somebody soon the steady eyes of children in gaza,
yearning for a little extra electricity
to cool their lemons and cantaloupes, will be known.
yes?
we talked for two hours via google chat,
they did not complain once. discussing stories,
books, families, a character who does
what you might do.
meanwhile secret diplomats are what we must be,

wahcawini didn’t want to scold the sky that year, but
grandma’s words taunted my senses. if there
is a thirst, then you need to pity the flowers
in a loud voice. ask the frogs why they are
being punished, stomp on the ground and talk
to the dried clay about cracking open the earth.
i know challenging the storm is risky. “last
but not least, burn cedar and pray the lightning
doesn’t strike your town.” that night, the stars disappeared, so did the birds. perhaps it was
the season for rain or the dance. in the western
distance, we thought we heard cannon blasts, looking over we watched the horizon fill with
lightning strikes. rain couldn’t pour hard enough
over the thirsty plain. accompanying clouds, called to thunder’s voice in extreme decimals
requesting all the water heaven could send forth,
to come. rain and more rain filled empty streambottoms. rivers who had pulled their dry banks
farther and farther from their center begged for
a drink to startle dusty beds with a flooding roar. lives in dormant places begin to stir and awaken.
the lives of water beings, those that swim, the
ones that hop, and the ones that fly, begin to stir. that year all thirst was quenched.

tracks are all that define these voices,
hungry lives pulsing sacred ground.
we are a journey of distressed shapes,
red essence on parchment, occupying a life.
we look for the fated four-legged that paced
this way, a tested and well-worn path
among storms, mud, into this shared hidden
brush. coyote, slipping by through old
winter grass, warns in a pagan tongue,
licking after our scent. we pick up pace,
tighten our careless reins, snap back at the
yellow-eyed clown with throat hunger,
that gnawing bone that drives us on. quieted,
we hear the heart beating. a desperate breath
crashes through dry branches, a silhouette
give away. in an instant we let go
of weapons and invite a quick death. we
watch our knives glistening. obsidian
works for us. what image of blood on flesh,
odor of iron. a vermilion sun heavy with
spring looks upon reflections of death
in hard visions, our favorable hunt—
whitetail not quick enough for downwind
lessons. our horses burdened, deer shadows
left on landscape, we push forward.
these tracks ours now. game will heal all.
our offspring dance, grandmother prepares a
fire and sharpens another knife. during the
feast we thank any god absent from our table.

this morning we found ourselves skinning a deer,
cutting meat, hanging some to dry and packaging
some for the freezer. it was the dogs late last night that set off a howling, the unexpected smell of fresh
blood floating down the block, then a familiar car
horn honking in the driveway. my nephew and his friends were hunting and brought us a deer. mother
always said, “cut up the meat right away, don’t let
it sit.” i look at a front quarter, a hole filled with coagulated blood. grandma says not to eat the part
next to the wound, “cut it out; offer it to the earth for
healing, a sacrifice to remember the hungering spirits.” auntie says to save the muscle along the back strap,
“it makes good thread.” i carefully learned the exact
place to cut the joints so the bones separate easily. mother said that is important—“it means you are a
thoughtful person.” auntie is at the door waiting for
a roast. “an elder takes the first piece,” she reminded. mom tells me to save the hooves for her. she wants
to make a bone game for the new grandchild, wants
him to be patient and skillful. i boil the hoofs with sage, find the little toe-bones for her. my hands begin
to ache from the work, i soak them in warm water
and start again. i admire the placement of tendons on the deer shoulders, no joints, just the crisscrossing
of muscle. grandma says, “that’s why your dad called
them jumpers, they bounce off the strength of their flexing muscles.” late at night mom helps me stake
out the hide. my back hurts; my feet feel like i’ve
been walking on rocks all day. i want to complain, but mom catches the look in my eyes. she says to me,
“when you get dressed for the dance this weekend,
you will proudly wear your beautiful beaded dress, your beaded leggings and moccasins, and last, but not
least, you will put on your beaded belt, and attached
you will wear your sharp knife and quilled knife sheath because of what you have done this day.”

i like the lady horses best,
how they make it all look easy,
like running 40 miles per hour
is as fun as taking a nap, or grass.
i like their lady horse swagger,
after winning. ears up, girls, ears up!
but mainly, let’s be honest, i like
that they’re ladies. as if this big
dangerous animal is also a part of me,
that somewhere inside the delicate
skin of my body, there pumps
an 8-pound female horse heart,
giant with power, heavy with blood.
don’t you want to believe it?
don’t you want to lift my shirt and see
the huge beating genius machine
that thinks, no, it knows,
it’s going to come in first.

a man celebrates erstwhile conquests,
his book locked in a silo, still in print. i scribble, make sharpie lines, deface
its text like it defaces me. outside, grainfields whisper. marble lions are silent
yet silver-tongued, with excellent teeth.in this life i have worshipped so many lies.
then i workshop them, make them better.an east india company, an opium trade,
a war, a treaty, a concession, an occupation ,a man parting the veil covering a woman’s
face, his nails prying her lips open. i love the fragility of a porcelain bowl. how easy
it is, to shatter chinoiserie, like the han dynasty urn ai weiwei dropped in 1995.
if only recovering the silenced history is as simple as smashing its container: book,
bowl, celadon spoon. such objects cross borders the way our bodies never could.
instead, we’re left with history, its blonde dust. that bowl is unbreakable. all its ghosts
still shudder through us like small breaths. the tome of hegemony lives on, circulates
in our libraries, in our bloodstreams. one day, a girl like me may come across it on a shelf,
pick it up, read about all the ways her body is a thing. and i won’t be there to protect
her, to cross the text out and say: go ahead—rewrite this.

the future is as sterile as a robot’s loincloth.
i drown my hands in sanitizer until they pucker. where this soapbox tree germinates, i collect
my germs and make a fountain of them. because yellow is yarrow and soot, and the future,
i’ve learned, is no suture. because where i’m from,
these kisses are infections. because dirt’s ammunition against discipline, the blood fills
my clean mouth with dismay. am i surprised—
hollywood still assumes we are all the bastard children of the same evil dictator? that phosgene
and mustard will rack our titanium maoist husks
until some white man with slanty eyes rescues us from our mealy, pliant selves? am i to wear dior,
wrap my mouth in bloody tulle, before kneeling,
bending to kiss a mouth dirtied by pantone 136? no fucking thanks. because where i’m from,
these kisses are infractions. darlings, let’s rewrite
the script. let’s hijack the narrative, steer the story ourselves. there’d be a heist, a battle.
audre lorde would write the script. my leading
man would be bruce. we’d earn our happy ending. instead, they give me 1981. 2012. quantum quasars,
new dystopia—plutonium wars. we’re not in polanski’s
chinatown anymore. yet we still have the same bowl haircuts. bangs, big bang, a city of fetid promise, new
minor galaxy where we cannot touch. instead our skin
is rust and metal. it gratifies the technophile in all of us.

in the autumn i moved to new york,
i recognized her face all over the subway
stations—pearls around her throat, she poses
for her immigration papers. in 1924, the only
americans required to carry identity cards
were ethnically chinese—the first photo ids,
red targets on the head of every man, woman,
child, infant, movie star. like pallbearers,
they lined up to get their pictures taken: full-face
view, direct camera gaze, no smiles, ears showing,
in silver gelatin. a rogue’s gallery of chinese
exclusion. the subway poster doesn’t name
her—though it does mention her ethnicity,
and the name of the new-york historical
society exhibition: exclusion/inclusion.
soon, when i felt alone in this city, her face
would peer at me from behind seats, turnstiles,
heads, and headphones, and i swear she wore
a smile only i could see. sometimes my face
aligned with hers, and we would rush past
the bewildered lives before us—hers, gone
the year my mother was born, and mine,
a belt of ghosts trailing after my scent.
in the same aboveground train, in the same
city where slain umbrellas travel across
the hudson river, we live and live.
i’ve left my landline so ghosts can’t dial me
at midnight with the hunger of hunters
anymore. i’m so hungry i gnaw at light.
it tunnels from the shadows, an exhausting
hope. i know this hunger tormented her too.
it haunted her through her years in l.a., paris,
and new york, the parties she went to, people
she met—paul robeson, zora neale hurston,
langston hughes, gertrude stein. it haunts
her expression still, on the 6 train, grand
central station, an echo chamber behind
her eyes. but dear universe: if i can recognize
her face under this tunnel of endless shadows
against the luminance of all that is extinct
and oncoming, then i am not a stranger here.

the news

to the night sky a periodically
interrupted song to reach the forest
of my refuge, here where the lights are
where one dissolve esand appears. to see the hidden
files of your mind and listen listen as i cross the road
to find the fox of the funeral home’s
bewildering delight where there is laughter
marked by a mysterious blinking light that the occluded
erase the sun with, and i’ve lost my heart
for the present moment, as i fear it is one more day
to see others walkin the dark morning
of imposters and timeless life. i say
farewell to you, my love as i enter the darkness

as the world collapses and we say ‘yes’

this morning i went to the doctor
and talked to him about this move on new year’s eve i had trouble connecting
my thoughts on sade and reason we rang in the new year
with miriam makeba’s Africa i’d noticed that my inner life
had expanded, and that i was having trouble thinking through it. the doctor said that geodon
would loosen my thinking—i noticed that i’d been moving through life for 10 years
in a zyprexa mold. thought control, at its best, like a sonnet. i do not feel invaded
by the television that i never see. brenda made me feel more loved than ever this morning, as my thoughts
expanded. last night, in the slow cooker, i made lamb and goat curry—amazingly good. i’d thought
to send joel, and peter, and michael an email letting them know of my transition, but did not. the consequences
of this transition could be catastrophic. i feel more loving toward brenda than ever. i could die, or worse. as i meditated today
my books to the left of me seemed packed and dense against the wall. soon, chuck will be here
to play chess upstairs. i told the doctor this morning that the philosophy and religion of the cyborg
have not yet been written. my poetry
has just begun. i am a fourth form,
though not as dodie saw it. together, we can belong in this world. artaud
arrived at the double as i have. we share more in common
than i’d known before last night. i need less sleep than before, and i sleep better
and am more rested. i feel sad and cheated that i need to rely on drugs
so completely. i wonder about paul bowles’ stories. i need to reach out
to others through this. the doctor, this morning, said
that i was enlightened, but not quite there—somehow—i can’t remember
how. i doubt he knows what he means by “enlightenment.” i felt far away
from my sister yesterday, when she called. Michael talked to me of christ’s
tenderness. i feel tender in this moment. over and over i feel that words
do not represent me. i am not sure what that implies of my intentions
in using them. yesterday, brenda and i saw the warhol show of the last ten years
of his life. there seemed to have been hope to live meaningfully in capitalism then. 
the waves
of this beginning, the new life of my mind is settling. it’s been a while since i’ve written. i’ve decided
to mark my continuing with the seven tildes above. and i added a title tonight, muerto vecino, after zizek’s dubious interpretation
of kierkegaard’s neighbor, and because of the funeral home across the street. my thinking has changed, my being has changed,
i am more alert and more engaged in thinking through the world. and i am able to speak better. i don’t know what this means
about who i am. i try not to feel let down that for so much of my life i’ve been restrained by psychotropic drugs. before zyprexa it was even
worse, with up to 6 meds, as i’ve said over and over to friends. i feel the need to make clear what my obstacles have been. not for pity,
a little for pride, but also for hope. if i can do that, then maybe i can help someone not suffer so much, like brenda. i replaced the kitchen faucet
this past weekend. it makes me very happy that i was able to do it successfully, without ever having been handy before in my life, and after
spending most of my life disdainful of being practical in that way. what a joy to make brenda so happy. i don’t know how much longer i will live,
and have often thought, recently, that it would be tragic if i died anytime soon, but that it’s imperative that i accept death when it arrives, after
affirming life as fully as i can. it’s too easy, and stupid, to be simplistically oppositional. and to not know that people can ruin anything, but
that the substantial things have value of themselves, is foolish. i don’t want to stop at my own ignorance and lack of forbearance. i don’t believe in the west
on its own. as michael says, the only thing that makes sense here is love. i have everything i could possibly ever want or need for now. more books
will come, more music too. and love is immeasurable when it’s real. i am so grateful to have more waking time
on the weekends. i plan on making breakfast for brenda every saturday and sunday that i can
from now on. early. i see gardens in the future of our household. and i wonder about a great spirit. what does the name matter? i see the stones that live
without water. i see the smoke that cleanses my vision, and a network of consciousness, with each node another, on and on that way to the depths. my thinking will never
grasp it all because of that recursively created network of interior life. my thinking stops
then, barely able to contain the spherical and vast darkness from which all light arises. that’s why what i see is dark. it is brilliant
in its darkness. like onyx and flint. i can only talk around what i’ve seen the past couple of weeks. it reframes, completely, the rest of my creative
life and the rest of my days. all i aim to do now is to focus my attention, so that i can see it all again in retrospect. so that i can read
and gather more tools for understanding it. so that i understand myself, and something of the world, and love, and so that i help others. geodon
will not erase it. i’ve seen it already, many times. it is my natural state. i no longer see it as only hallucination. it is a way of being. a way that i can flesh
out, here. slowly. carefully. and as i do, its destructive powers, which are massive and righteous, will subside. as it will know that it is being
given to the world. because it belongs to all. and all will be there soon. there are signs already. because to see it is to break, unless one knows something
of love. it makes lsd small. it is god and the universe as one.
i am not the first to see it. but i am a person given a chance
to write it, letter by letter, slowly, in terms of the light of my ignorance to see more fully
what i do not know. i do not offer anything but poems. but it breaks through
my mouth to arrive at the hearts of the world, at the hearts of the horses of the world, to allow us all to speak in silence. it is not god or the universe.
it is one as all in you. because i cannot see through myself without it. i see clearly
that the sun will not arrive in this new weather. but that the moon
will take its place. i see clearly that the sun is thereto bring meaning to the sky, and that the earth is more full
with the light of the world extinguished for a brilliant view of wilderness. this is a view
that extends through opposites and arrives at a single body
to witness this song. and this song is not the answer that you believe in, because one day
i will speak to you again in the rain
and show you that i do not know. because knowledge
belongs to the earth. and the earth makes everything i know. and now that there is less and less freedom
from coercion in a moneyed world, and now that claire, a friend, is moving on to be christ in her own way, now
that guénon continues to call me to understand my ignorance, to depart again
from the friends at kuna yala, where i helped with the water, with brenda watching over me
from a hammock between palms, now that panama calls again to give me a union
of the world, in more than two ways, and to distinguish from the surface of these times, i
receive a call to awaken in the snow. i receive a call to acknowledge
that geodon has planted itself with capital
in my consciousness, but that the world is stronger than to balance itself
from the ozone and people alone. we are not erased, and we do not control the earth. geodon
is an act of kindness, an agreement to live this life
in a way that arrives with the weather. it may continue
for the rest of my life, or it may not. i will not be afraid again to see things as i do, and i will not
seek out the truth, intentionally, without some kind of agreement with this custom. because that is a way, for now,
that i speak. and it is useful, though better left invisible. and the name, geodon, brings trouble, i can see
through it enough, with enough love in my life, to believe in the end of the reign of the anti-christ (not obama). i need to learn again
to be and to write. but to deliver what i saw
i must return to the explosion of my inner life. to start with, otherwise and generally, i see
only outlines. creation manifests from every direction, in an infinity
of dimensions. most of us spend most of our energy
conscious of a very few of these dimensions. imagine more than the greatest works of art
manifesting endlessly from more directions than one can possibly count
every micro second, timelessly. it’s glorious. and the only way to see it with any balance
is impeccably, ethically, compassionately, and with at least an aim toward the divine. it is the divine. god and the universe
spoke to me. it is all, always, speaking to us. and what it say sis endless
it brings wholeness to the precious moment. it goes away
when one tries to pin it down, as i do. i say less and less as i try to describe it. it is endlessly
generative. it is good but pitiless and merciful. it demands of us
that we arrive. and now that the thinking manifests in a way that allows
for union and a bridge, in a way that avoids easy condemnation, a thinking that reveals
the links toward light in motion, a primordial
form of being in a new world that needs no one
to believe in it, a vast chasm in what a bureaucracy of thought
tries to pin us down with, the hole in time that allows us to be free
is here, we know it. all of us can see through delusion. there is no road
in the aftermath of earthquakes, no need for the time to extinguish the elements, no person
locked to your heart in the morning, no water to drink
without thirst, no air is necessary to breathe under the water of seeing, no
need for the earth to do anything other than revolve, in this
new light. space undoes our links
to the immovable. we deliver the undone to the plains
and see what the harvest will fill with seed. the whole
does not exist within outlines. all we can do
is move to it. the music is unheard of
in this world. it exists without origin. it is otherworldly,
primordial, and gentle. it vibrates, equally, in the lamb, in
the lotus, in the stones—there is no place
unknown to it. it is music, and nothing more,
and nothing less. it is that everywhere possible. it is harmonious
infinitely, and allows for any sound. to some it might seem like noise, but that
is only the part. to achieve it one need only listen. i cannot always
hear it, but i have heard it. and now
in my new mind, i listen for it undaunted and silent. i feel it filling
my body with love. sometimes i have horrific thoughts. but i am learning
that these are but strong notes in the fullness
of the music of my new mind. i can’t always hear the song,
but i feel it now. it makes all context vast. i will receive it
as long as it is here. i will not push one way or the other with it. it is a fullness
and does not want to be made into a force. it is a force
without me, and only to the degree to which this is true. no longer being able
to receive it will imply a failure
of my imagination, of my ethics, and my spirit. there is no way
to hold on to it. it serves no one. and it includes us all. to continue to receive it
more fully i grow. this implies
the world. it implies clarity. it implies motion. but it rests motionlessly. if i have a softness in my voice
it is caused by this music. when i don’t i feel less. my voice can be loud
to receive it, but this loudness cannot be yoked
in outlines. there is nothing i can do. there is nothing to expect. i can only
let it go. and i can only be afraid of the horror of my thoughts
without this music. but now that i know a taste of it, i have
hope. good people feed it. i haven’t always known
what to do with it and others. but now i am a little less confused
about this. this is dueto buddhism, the little that i know
of its practice. and to love. but it does not stop at my experience. i am ignorant
and cannot offer knowledge. except this music
does not require knowledge. i’m not sure what it requires. it requires
to be received, but does not need us. is there a pact between humanity
and god? i don’t know. is there a god? i don’t know. i’m not sure the question
is enough on its own. or maybe it is, if god is not limited by concept. and concept
seems to be only a note in this song. problems feed it. “love
is the absence of fear.” and “love believes all things,
yet is never deceived.” i aim to see through my delusions. i aim
to be one of many, a small voice in the song of the world. i rest
in silence as i always have. “to have a view
as vast as the sky and as fine
as a grain of sand.” all beings want to be loved
and to be free from suffering. we strive
diligently to learn the vast expanse
and the laser pointed focus of this gift. remember that light
makes us. and that in this new world, more and more
is made of light. and if that is the case, we move to move
the light of the world. someday, perhaps, we will move
the light of the computer world. only the compassionate
and true will be able to do so. because only they
can be selfless enough to let it move through them. i am not there
to move it but i saw this. long ago. briefly. i was offered
a glimpse. it is utterly simple and beyond thought. there is hope. intention
is a thought. so one sees. i cannot tangle
myself in the line. but only to bridge. that is part of why
it will all move. but i cannot wait until that is possible
to become. i can wait eternally and actively in the world
to remain still. with the calm and expansive
link that allows us to live, so preciously
together, i see through the trouble that startles me, every moment
and allow the seeing of my inner eye
to burn through it. i do not remember what zyprexa was like any longer. except that it seems
i have more to work with now, with my mind. and these words are plain, so as to be careful in this new place. i see
that they do not break open my heart, as i read. and for that i relinquish this poem, and allow it to be only
a mark on the road to further inquiry. i allow it to see as i have made a vow to bridge, that my life
aims to be whole, even in the face of potential catastrophes, i grow more and more
to accept death as it arrives, to allow it to soften me, and to transform me as i have been transformed through geodon, only
to know that there is an isthmus, and that it is eternal. only that there is one heart to allow myself to speak
in the storms of tribulation, as one speaks to allow the teamwork of the fabric of need
of the bird malingerer to see this in the aftermath of one who has died. like a bicycle never once
together enough to ride, i see this word here, again, to the removal of a people, to the homeland of union and pace, to the isthmus
of a double link, one ocean to another, one continent to another, to the only union (even as it may be erased in my history), the place
of one heart to allow the song to continue through conflict as she saw it then, one time, far away, when i hadn’t known yet, that this
would be timeless. and there is one to it there to see it there, to allow it there to become and to see there as one is there to see
and to allow one to arrive with it there and to see, and to be one with it there as one is there to be with it. and to see there as one is there to believe
as it is one to believe it there and to see it there as one with the soil and the air and the light and rain
and to be there with one to be there one with it there once again, and to see it there and to believe as there is one there to believe it there again and to see. and to see
there as one is there to believe as it is there again and to see there as one is there to arrive and to be with it
there and to see it there once again and to see it there again and to believe as there is one to it again and to see and to hold
and to see it there and to hold being that nothing holds

waking to the news of an eventual collapse, those ejected minds
of the walking thing of the speech of birds, they announce their own
development from ashes to make a song and deliver the hunted
landscape to its stars, those of us who knew something of the engine
would remove the approach to animals as a second wind, the coming
of pages of light and nectar, but once the arrival of her tent
would move the inhabitants of the sea, and the consciousness of the ocean
to pursue the network that sparks their shining single dream
to the pavement, the oceanic feet that would not muse its face or
deter those breaks from the second light of the morning, or one would
say the easy atonements that their push from the animal
would enlarge so that they would speak and we would understand,
these assembly code calypsos deter the kindly face that hates and pummels
as these will undo their coloring and the fur of the path. do not stop
until you know it well with both feet.

my father, just
out of his teens, stands on the rooftop
of the embassy in saigon, his birthplace.
he gives his hand to his mother,
and all around them, a thousand hands reach up not to wave. none of his siblings died.
their bodies like a fine chain balled tight
in a fist. they made it out alive.
why is he looking at me like this?2this is the idea of a house my father built
in southern california. these two circle windows
and bamboo on all sides. he brought a jungle here,
complete with french doors.
these are the tiles from his mother’s house, cool
against my cheek. i talk to him in one tongue,
he answers from the morgue.3let’s get on with it.
when i return to that house, i eat the food
left out for my dead brother. i don’t waste much.
i slide open and close his closet, untangle
the window blinds. the bees are quiet in the
walls, now, their colonies dying off.
his shoes on my father’s feet are the only moving thing
in sight.4on their flight to america,
the choice for lunch was rice or pasta, but when
the meal cart reached them, there was only pasta.
my father smiled at the flight attendant and asked,
why didn’t you reap enough rice?5the certificates we use to be certain of each other:
id cards, contracts, permits, deeds,
fishing licenses, driving licenses, car titles, carry permits,
registrations, income statements, ious, testimonials,
certificates of birth, custody, and death, letters of consent.
do i have permission to approach
a drowning man from behind?6i dreamed last night, my mother says,
that you were in danger and your brother was young still,
though you were the same
as you are now.
he was looking for me and i was looking for you.7i sit at my desk, typing and deleting
words.
twice i dreamed i fucked my brother.
i keep trying to wake up. i keep getting things wrong.
i’m ready to feel better.

gradually a girl’s innocence itself becomes her major crime
a doe and her two fawns bent low in the sumac along the bank of a highway,
the pinched peach of their ears twitching in the heat
into the disordered evening my brother cut out only his face from every
photograph in the hall, carefully slipping each frame back into position
what good does it do?
decades of no faces other than our own chipping faces
what good does it do, this resemblance to nothing we know of the dollhouse
new parents watch their newborn resting in a sunny patch of an empty
room, the newborn making sense of its container—
and from the road a deer ripened in death and a tuft of fur—or dandelion—
tumbled along, gently circled, driftwood, shaking loose, gathered,
dissolving into the mouths of jewelweed nearby
earth is rife with iron and blood is rich in stardust
immediately i spotted one hoof print, then nothing, as if this was where she
dragged herself out of the body
strips of tire torn from their orbit is it right then, that we are left to hurtle alone

there is a house in me. it is empty. i empty it. negative space: the only native emptiness there is.
there is
an alarm goes off. it goes on and on. when the alarm
drifts to different parts of the room, i realize, that alarm is the sun.
and there is no one who does not need, never an empty seat. and the blind one, he does not find a place. there is a god in him
helping him to need himself.
a mother sticks a spoon into my chest,
which is an empty bowl, actually, so the spoon lands quickly
and loudly. heartbreak in the heart! she says. when you love someone
more than you’ve ever known you could, it is
a good thing, except for the terrifying realization that one day there comes
a parting.

what should i call this poem i’ll call it a rush of chambers
a racket of foliage i’ll call it love poem with dark
face pretty title someone i don’t know who tells me watch
out for words with meaning don’t look for truth in beauty
learn to breathe with your gaze in an art gallery
a woman with sad eyes devours rats devours picassos
sleeps in hospital rooms listen to this story once upon
a time a princess bah death will not be long in coming
death with its blue eyes on my empty plate[2]
she’ll never know who i am she’s blind and hates when people
look at her i offer her a bonfire a fistful of snow offer her
a freshly cut rose what should we talk about now? let’s talk
about the sky let’s talk about fear there’s going to be a storm tonight
a person would do better to drop and never get up how’s that i ask
but she disappears i don’t know if she’ll ever return still
i wait with my milk tooth with my old stamp
collection with my razor blade and a mirror at night
she comes whispers in my ear there’s no one but you
in a million years i’ll learn her real name know
her dark face flush with sky flush with fear[3]
why am i writing this? you incandescent pupil i’m a swan
that dreams of dying in your dream inside a box where hell burns
where everything is blinding the storm doesn’t say a word stays mute
you should have seen me that time the vineyards were
in bloom the cows were grazing i was happy you were happy
the enigma’s transparence cooled our coffee the myth’s
dissection the death of any and all theories i’m a swan
my dream is to die in your dream why didn’t you look at me?[4]
my students asked me what is the meaning of pain
so i sliced a doll’s finger with a razor blade there
was no blood no batting of lashes this i told them is pain[5]
i read and write at the same time it’s only proper the mountains
overwhelmingly approve the night shuts one eye and looks at me
with the other there is nothing around but plastic flowers
purgatories on the brink of closure doors and windows the light
grows impatient time destroys clocks may i speak?
there’s no need to the pages are on fire your lamp is burning
i take off my clothes and let the cold ignite my penis[6]
now i come to the hardest part of the story the part
where i talk about porpoises and dolphins the woman
with the sad eyes vomits rats into the toilet i speak of
my desire i don’t want her to know about it i’ll just say a word
brush my hand against her hair and if she runs ah the lost words
the dark rooms each with its death rattle of birds
all soaring skyward the woman closes her eyes
go in me she says i’ve forgotten your name i don’t have
a name from high above the bed a god observes us
his wounded body conveying how much she wants me[7]
sorrowful boy come whenever you like i’ll burn in your memory sear
your tongue all kinds of confusion will find a place in your senses
any expression will be allegory in our hands i have a notebook
for you a glass of water some dead fish i said to her sorrowful girl
i love notebooks await every night a glass of water
on my tongue dead fish are a delirium my students
ask what’s delirium i unbutton my shirt and show them
your breasts this is delirium[8]
a rush of overflowing chambers it’s playtime now you’re
the shadow and i’m the light you lick my wounds while i sink
into the lightning flash into both sets of darkness where you sleep
and i await the word smoke is the word tomorrow
your body and mine will sing and there will again be woods
unfurling before my eyes open venetian blinds a fount
of angels atop the dirty laundry tell me a story anything
what’s important is that we awaken and not give in to sleep
happy loves rot as surely as blighted ones do
bye bye she says bye bye flowers in her wounded hands[9]
to let the body not love drift through other bodies
that’s how banishment how violent expulsion begins quite
a lovely light is dying amid the debris no one can see it
ice is deceptive when it shines bright the sky an irrevocable
past a voice inspiring pity a voice that never reaches us[10]
disturbing the marble slab’s geometry beneath her feet
the sought-after metaphor is a blue cyclone the dark alley
the grave of all projects though nothing stands in our way
we can be happy but there’s no one here only me besides
the words the untimely trips and scarlet buses i remember
her light which made the pain grow dark and still she went away
i followed until i lost her trace no one ever taught me to lose a desire
a purple cloud envelopes my body the students ask me
what is a body i draw a word in the air the word bursts
and drops to the ground this i tell them is a body

i wonder where the title the smoke of distant fires comes from
i heard it in a park once at the back of my creeping devoted
ear the moon was red the forest as always abloom with
heliotropes and blue begonias yes i heard it in a park once
a dog was barking the moon was red the sun had already set
eyeing my steps she’d say good but with less emphasis
the words stank to high heaven the serpent was singing sweetly
careful she told me it’s a monstrosity a misshapen beast
years ago i placed a leaf from a linden tree on his back
which left only a scratch a mere flesh wound where time
records its march where the mangled falcon sleeps the blood
on kriemhild’s breasts recalling the blood on kriemhild’s
breasts her death at the hands of some hunter of wild
boars the serpent was dancing the moon was red the
hero didn’t seem to notice i have lost the pot of gold
he said i don’t know who could have stolen it from me
the trees let go of their branches allowing them to fall
it was spring and they couldn’t bear the weight of the snow
the sun shone darkly deer came down from the hills
rats fled the swamp and everything before me was allegory
yet i didn’t write a word
who is eyeing my steps? who is dictating me words?
who is telling me now is the time? i don’t knowwho is eyeing my steps who is dictating me words who
is telling me now is the time
i’m with my parents in melbourne this has to be a dream
i’ve never been to melbourne my parents look at a plate of
food with no interest one way or the other i feel uncomfortable
at times that’s how i remember you i can never get past
your eyes i don’t have any eyes ask siegfried ask the serpent
ask him what’s become of your words of the papers you
tossed in the wastebasket of the much hoped-for rain in the linden
tree forest i’m talking about hell about charon’s coins
about the barking dog the one that won’t let us sleep
we’re not in melbourne and this is no dream truth
to tell i don’t know where we are i see a park nearby hear
some music the rustling of leaves we’re alone tonight
you’re like a tiger i love your fear the streak of light rending
your shadow the solar mantle where beauty burns forget
the flesh for a moment forget about beauty for now you’re
with me tonight why is the moon so red she asks
it isn’t night and we aren’t in park we’re in the bais
at either the beginning or the end of a storm it’s like a line
you know by heart memory can be so cruel preserving
a marble column a red desert and nothing else around them
but rocks spiders scorpions a pious crowd and a rabbit
why a pious crowd she asks why a rabbit i must have read
about them in a poem seen them in a medieval painting or some
movie short perhaps praying high in the air i grasped the serpent
and if a cloud brushed my ears i gave god thanks for it was his hand
he ordered me to read but no one had ever taught me how
you must be simeon then she said pointing out my sandals
my lack of social graces my eyes brimming over with desert
she listens to the rustling of the leaves to the whistling of the wind
tell me we’ve always been here tell me you never went away
read me the part about the hero’s betrayal the dream of the eagle
devouring the falcon tell me it’s nighttime our neighbors wave
at us with no interest one way or the other the birds pick apart
their nests
on the riverbank a dog barks a dog that won’t let us sleep
water and mud common ground sketch their alphabet the metaphor
is burning i see it shrivel to nothing amid the rubble we don’t
need to write don’t need to read tonight the serpent
is very excited for it’s celebrating a birth as the words rot
and the moon shines a charon’s palm what should i do? hold on to it she says write the smoke of distant fires

wandering slowly back after dark one night
above a river, toward a suspension bridge,
a sound concerns him that might be a tune
or might not: noise drifting in, trailing off. then concerns him again, now clearly a song
pulsing out from the opposite bank, being sung
by chorusing men, all pewter-haired or bald,
in the function suite of a shabby hotel.
above their heads a conductor’s hand
draws and casts the notes with a white wand. songs about mills and mines and a great war,
about mermaid brides and solid gold hills,
songs from broken hymnbooks and cheesy films. then his father’s voice rising out of that choir,
and his father’s father’s voice, and voices
of fathers before, concerning him only,
arcing through charged air and spanning the gorge.
he steps over the cliff edge and walks across.

you wanna know what happened to elvis
i’ll tell you what happened
i ought a know man i was one of his army
i mean man i was on his side
he made us feel all right
we were the first wave in the
postwar baby boom
the generation before had just come
out of the great depression and world war ii
you know heavy vibes for people to wear
so much heaviness like some kind of
voiding of the emotions their music you know the songs
life always carries
you know every culture has songs
well anyway their music was
restrained emotion
you know like you didn’t wanna dance
if you didn’t know how
which says something strange
well anyway elvis came along
about ten years after the nuke
when the only generals america had in
the only army she had were ike and mac
and stupor hung over the land
a plague where everyone tried to
materially free themselves
still too shell-shocked to understand
to feel what was happening everything was getting hopeless
then when elvis started to rock
the roll just picked up
i mean drabness the beaver showed us
could only be a foretold future
who wanted to be ward and june and
i mean father never did know best
he was still crazy from surviving the warlike there was this psychotic pall
so widespread as to be assumed normal
heavy man
you know really
anyway elvis showed us an out
you know he showed every boyman and
every girlwoman there’s something good
in feeling good
like a prophet for everyboy everygirl
when someones mom and dad lied
something about him told us
to be sensual is really okay
someones mom and dad waltzed us around
everygirl wasn’t supposed to enjoy it
if she did she was bad and everyboy
well boys will be boys don’t feel anything
take what you can
marry a decent girl when the fun’s done
like no matter what we did we all were guilty
maybe someones mom and dad resented
what they missed and while
they were trying to pass it on us
we heard elvis’s song and
for the first time we made up our own mind the first wave rebelled
i mean we danced even if we didn’t know how
i mean elvis made us move
instead of standing mute he raised our voice
and when we heard ourselves something
was changing you know like for the first time
we made a collective decision about choices america hurriedly made pat boone
a general in the army they wanted us to join
but most of us held fast to elvis
and the commandants around him
chuck berry buddy holly little richard
bo diddley gene vincent
you know
like a different civil war all over again i mean you take don’t be cruel
i want you i need you i love you
and jailhouse rock
or you take pat and his white bucks
singing love letters in the sand
hell man what’s real here
i mean pat at the beach in his white bucks
his ears getting sunburned told us
something about old wave delusion
i mean wanting and needing and imprisonment
we all been to those places but what did
white bucks at the beach understand
other than more straight line dancing
you know what i mean anyway man for a while we had a breather
fresh energy to keep us from falling into the big sleep
then before long elvis got assassinated in all the fame
taking a long time to die others seized
control while elvis rode the needle out
never understanding what he’d done it’s like we were the baby boom because
life needed a fresher start
i mean two world wars in a row is
really crazy man
and elvis even though he didn’t know he said it
he showed it to us anyway and even though
we didn’t know we heard it we heard it anyway man like he woke us up
and now they’re trying to put us
back to sleep so we’ll see how it goes
anyway look at the record man
rock ’n’ roll is based on revolution
going way past 33 1/3
you gotta understand man he was
america’s baby boom che
i oughta know man
i was in his army

even now, after all
these years, my father, 89,
still uncertain when i call
whose voice it is—ann's or mine—saying hi, dad, and from where,
the next town or a different state,
still pausing in that powdered air,
this little silence as he waits at the nursery door, discerning tone
and pitch, listening hard to know
which way to bend, which crib, the one
against the wall or by the window, still concentrating, trying to keep
us separate, our needs, do what she would, letting my mother sleep,
this moment's blank as he's about to choose between us, make some shift
in the soft-lit dark, decide whose cry
it is tonight, which girl to lift,
to whisper or hum, which lullaby.

you whom i could not save, listen to me. can we agree kevlar
backpacks shouldn’t be needed for children walking to school?
those same children also shouldn’t require a suit
of armor when standing on their front lawns, or snipers
to watch their backs as they eat at mcdonalds.
they shouldn’t have to stopt o consider the speed
of a bullet or how it might reshape their bodies. but
one winter, back in detroit, i had one student
who opened a door and died. it was the front
door of his house, but it could have been any door,
and the bullet could have written any name. the shooter
was thirteen years old and was aiming
at someone else. but a bullet doesn’t care
about “aim,” it doesn’t distinguish between
the innocent and the innocent, and how was the bullet
supposed to know this child would open the door
at the exact wrong moment because his friend
was outside and screaming for help. did i say
i had “one” student who opened a door and died?
that’s wrong. there were many.
the classroom of grief had far more seats
than the classroom for math though every student
in the classroom for math could count the names
of the dead. a kid opens a door. the bullet
couldn’t possibly know, nor could the gun, because
“guns don’t kill people,” they don’t have minds to decide
such things, they don’t choose or have a conscience,
and when a man doesn’t have a conscience, we call him
a psychopath. this is how we know what type of assault rifle
a man can be, and how we discover
the hell that thrums inside each of them. today,
there’s another shooting with dead
kids everywhere. it was a school, a movie theater, a parking lot.
the world is full of doors.
and you, whom i cannot save, you may open a door
and enter a meadow or a eulogy.
and if the latter, you will be mourned, then buried
in rhetoric. there will be
monuments of legislation, little flowers made
from red tape.
what should we do? we’ll ask
again. the earth will close like a door above you. what should we do? and that click you hear?
that’s just our voices, the deadbolt of discourse
sliding into place.

orphan in my first years, i early learnt
to make my heart suffice itself, and seek
support and sympathy in its own depths. well, read my cheek, and watch my eye, —
too strictly school'd are they
one secret of my soul to show,
one hidden thought betray. i never knew the time my heart
look'd freely from my brow;
it once was check'd by timidness,
'tis taught by caution now. i live among the cold, the false,
and i must seem like them;
and such i am, for i am false
as those i most condemn. i teach my lip its sweetest smile,
my tongue its softest tone;
i borrow others' likeness, till
almost i lose my own. i pass through flattery's gilded sieve,
whatever i would say;
in social life, all, like the blind,
must learn to feel their way. i check my thoughts like curbed steeds
that struggle with the rein;
i bid my feelings sleep, like wrecks
in the unfathom'd main. i hear them speak of love, the deep.
the true, and mock the name;
mock at all high and early truth,
and i too do the same. i hear them tell some touching tale,
i swallow down the tear;
i hear them name some generous deed,
and i have learnt to sneer. i hear the spiritual, the kind,
the pure, but named in mirth;
till all of good, ay, even hope,
seems exiled from our earth. and one fear, withering ridicule,
is all that i can dread;
a sword hung by a single hair
for ever o'er the head. we bow to a most servile faith,
in a most servile fear;
while none among us dares to say
what none will choose to hear. and if we dream of loftier thoughts,
in weakness they are gone;
and indolence and vanity
rivet our fetters on. surely i was not born for this!
i feel a loftier mood
of generous impulse, high resolve,
steal o'er my solitude! i gaze upon the thousand stars
that fill the midnight sky;
and wish, so passionately wish,
a light like theirs on high. i have such eagerness of hope
to benefit my kind;
and feel as if immortal power
were given to my mind. i think on that eternal fame,
the sun of earthly gloom.
which makes the gloriousness of death,
the future of the tomb —that earthly future, the faint sign
of a more heavenly one;
— a step, a word, a voice, a look, —
alas! my dream is done! and earth, and earth's debasing stain,
again is on my soul;
and i am but a nameless part
of a most worthless whole. why write i this? because my heart
towards the future springs,
that future where it loves to soar
on more than eagle wings. the present, it is but a speck
in that eternal time,
in which my lost hopes find a home,
my spirit knows its clime. oh! not myself, — for what am i? —
the worthless and the weak,
whose every thought of self should raise
a blush to burn my cheek. but song has touch’d my lips with fire.
and made my heart a shrine;
for what, although alloy'd, debased,
is in itself divine. i am myself but a vile link
amid life's weary chain;
but i have spoken hallow'd words,
o do not say in vain! my first, my last, my only wish,
say will my charmed chords
wake to the morning light of fame,
and breathe again my words? will the young maiden, when her tears
alone in moonlight shine —
tears for the absent and the loved —
murmur some song of mine? will the pale youth by his dim lamp,
himself a dying flame,
from many an antique scroll beside,
choose that which bears my name? let music make less terrible
the silence of the dead;
i care not, so my spirit last
long after life has fled.

oh! yet one smile, tho' dark may lower 
around thee clouds of woe and ill, 
let me yet feel that i have power, 
mid fate's bleak storms, to soothe thee still. 
tho' sadness be upon thy brow, 
yet let it turn, dear love, to me, 
i cannot bear that thou should'st know 
sorrow i do not share with thee. 
true love's wreath is of mountain flowers, 
they stand the storm and brave the blast, 
and blossom on, so love like ours 
is sweetest when all else is past. 
too well i know what storms have frowned, 
and now frown on life's troubled tide; 
still darker let them gather round, 
they have no power on hearts so tried. 
then say not that you may not bear, 
to shadow spirit light as mine; 
i shall not shrink, or fear to share 
the darkest fate if it be thine! oh! say not love was never made 
for heart so light as mine; 
must love then seek the cypress shade, 
rear but a gloomy shrine. 
oh! say not, that for me more meet 
the revelry of youth; 
or that my wild heart cannot beat 
with deep devoted truth. 
tho' mirth may many changes ring, 
'tis but an outward show, 
even upon the fond dove's wing 
will varying colours glow. 
light smiles upon my lip may gleam 
and sparkle o'er my brow, 
'tis but the glisten of the stream 
that hides the gold below. 
'tis love that gilds the mirthful hour, 
that lights the smile for me, 
those smiles would instant lose their power, 
did they not glance on thee! oh! come to my slumber 
sweet dreams of my love, 
i have hung the charmed wreath 
my soft pillow above. 
the roses are linked 
in a chain pure and white; 
and the rose-leaves are wet 
with the dew drops of night. 
the moon was on high 
as i gather'd each flower; 
the dew that then falls 
has a magical power. 
the spirit of slumber 
those roses has blest; 
and sweet are the visions 
they'll bring to my rest. 
be their spell on my soul, 
so they let me but see 
his dark eyes flash in love 
and his smile glance on me. 
let sleep bring the image 
of him far away; 
'tis worth all the tears 
i shed for him by day. 
i have hung the charmed wreath 
my soft pillow above; 
then come to my slumber, 
sweet dreams of my love! how vain to cast my love away 
on bosom false as thine; 
the floweret's bloom, that springs in may, 
would be a safer shrine 
to build my fondest hopes upon, 
tho' fragile it may be. 
that flower's smile is not sooner gone 
than love that trusts to thee. 
love asks a calm, a gentle home, 
or else its life is o'er; 
if once you let its pinions roam, 
oh! then 'tis love no more. 
the aspin's changefui shade can be 
no shelter for the dove; 
and hearts as varying as that tree, 
are sure no place for love. 
hope linger'd long and anxiously, 
o'er failing faith, but now 
i give thee back each heartless sigh, 
give back each broken vow. 
i'll trust the stay of tulip dyes, 
the calm of yon wild sea, 
the sunshine of the april skies, 
but never more to thee! oh! would that love had power to raise 
a little isle for us alone, 
with fairy flowers, and sunny rays, 
the blue sea wave its guardian zone. 
no other step should ever press 
this hidden eden of the heart, 
and we would share its loveliness, 
from every other thing apart. 
the rose and violet should weep, 
whene'er our leafy couch was laid, 
the lark should wake our morning sleep, 
the bulbul sing our serenade. 
and we would watch the starry hours, 
and call the moon to hear our vows, 
and we would cull the sweetest flowers, 
and twine fresh chaplets for our brows. i thought thus of the flowers, the moon, 
this fairy isle for you and me; 
and then i thought how very soon 
how very tired we should be. matrimonial creed.
he must be rich whom i could love, 
his fortune clear must be, 
whether in land or in the funds, 
'tis all the same to me. 
he must be old whom i could love, 
then he'll not plague me long; 
in sooth 'twill he a pleasant sight,
to see him borne along 
to where the croaking ravens lurk, 
and where the earth worms dwell: 
a widow's hood will suit my face,
and black becomes me well. 
and he must make a settlement, 
i'll have no man without; 
and when he writes his testament, 
he must not leave me out. 
oh! such a man as this would suit 
each wish i here express; 
if he should say, — will you have me? 
i'll very soon say — yes! ⁠

was she of spirit race, or was she one
of earth's least earthly daughters, one to whom
a gift of loveliness and soul is given,
only to make them wretched? there is an antique gem, on which her brow
retains its graven beauty even now.
her hair is braided, but one curl behind
floats as enamour'd of the summer wind;
the rest is simple. is she not too fair
even to think of maiden's sweetest care?
the mouth and brow are contrasts. one so fraught
with pride, the melancholy pride of thought
conscious of power, and yet forced to know
how little way such power as that can go;
regretting, while too proud of the fine mind,
which raises but to part it from its kind:
but the sweet mouth had nothing of all this;
it was a mouth the rose had lean'd to kiss
for her young sister, telling, now though mute,
how soft an echo it was to the lute.
the one spoke genius, in its high revealing;
the other smiled a woman's gentle feeling.
it was a lovely face: the greek outline
flowing, yet delicate and feminine;
the glorious lightning of the kindled eye,
raised, as it communed with its native sky.
a lovely face the spirit's fitting shrine;
the one almost, the other quite divine.my hand is on the lyre which never more
with its sweet commerce, like a bosom friend,
will share the deeper thoughts which i could trust
only to music and to solitude.
it is the very grove, the olive grove,
where first i laid my laurel crown aside,
and bathed my fever'd brow in the cold stream;
as if that i could wash away the fire
which from that moment kindled in my heart.
i well remember how i flung myself,
like a young goddess, on a purple cloud
of light and odour — the rich violets
were so ethereal in bloom and breath:
and i — i felt immortal, for my brain
was drunk and mad with its first draught of fame.
'tis strange there was one only cypress tree,
and then, as now, i lay beneath its shade.
the night had seen me pace my lonely room,
clasping the lyre i had no heart to wake,
impatient for the day: yet its first dawn
came cold as death; for every pulse sank down,
until the very presence of my hope
became to me a fear.
the sun rose up;
i stood alone 'mid thousands: but i felt
mine inspiration; and, as the last sweep
of my song died away amid the hills,
my heart reverb'rated the shout which bore
to the blue mountains and the distant heaven erinna's name, and on my bended knee,
olympus, i received thy laurel crown. and twice new birth of violets have sprung,
since they were first my pillow, since i sought
in the deep silence of the olive grove
the dreamy happiness which solitude
brings to the soul o'erfill'd with its delight:
for i was like some young and sudden heir
of a rich palace heap'd with gems and gold,
whose pleasure doubles as he sums his wealth
and forms a thousand plans of festival;
such were my myriad visions of delight.
the lute, which hitherto in delphian shades
had been my twilight's solitary joy,
would henceforth be a sweet and breathing bond
between me and my kind.
orphan unloved,
i had been lonely from my childhood's hour,
childhood whose very happiness is love:
but that was over now; my lyre would be
my own heart's true interpreter, and those
to whom my song was dear, would they not bless
the hand that waken'd it? i should be loved
for the so gentle sake of those soft chords
which mingled others' feelings with mine own. vow'd i that song to meek and gentle thoughts,
to tales that told of sorrow and of love,
to all our nature's finest touches, all
that wakens sympathy: and i should be
alone no longer; every wind that bore,
and every lip that breathed one strain of mine,
henceforth partake in all my joy and grief.
oh! glorious is the gifted poet's lot,
and touching more than glorious: 'tis to be
companion of the heart's least earthly hour;
the voice of love and sadness, calling forth
tears from their silent fountain: 'tis to have
share in all nature's loveliness; giving flowers
a life as sweet, more lasting than their own;
and catching from green wood and lofty pine
language mysterious as musical;
making the thoughts, which else had only been
like colours on the morning's earliest hour,
immortal, and worth immortality;
yielding the hero that eternal name
for which he fought; making the patriot's deed
a stirring record for long after-time;
cherishing tender thoughts, which else had pass'd
away like tears; and saving the loved dead
from death's worst part — its deep forgetfulness. from the first moment when a falling leaf,
or opening bud, or streak of rose-touch'd sky,
waken'd in me the flush and flow of song,
i gave my soul entire unto the gift
i deem'd mine own, direct from heaven; it was
the hope, the bliss, the energy of life;
i had no hope that dwelt not with my lyre,
no bliss whose being grew not from my lyre,
no energy undevoted to my lyre.
it was my other self that had a power;
mine, but o'er which i had not a control.
at times it was not with me, and i felt
a wonder how it ever had been mine:
and then a word, a look of loveliness,
a tone of music, call'd it into life;
a song came gushing, like the natural tears,
to check whose current does not rest with us. had i lived ever in the savage woods,
or in some distant island, which the sea
with wind and wave guards in deep loneliness;
had my eye never on the beauty dwelt
of human face, and my ear never drank
the music of a human voice; i feel
my spirit would have pour'd itself in song,
have learn'd a language from the rustling leaves,
the singing of the birds, and of the tide.
perchance, then, happy had i never known
another thought could be attach'd to song
than of its own delight.
oh! let me pause
over this earlier period, when my heart
mingled its being with its pleasures, fill'd
with rich enthusiasm, which once flung
its purple colouring o'er all things of earth,
and without which our utmost power of thought
but sharpens arrows that will drink our blood.
like woman's soothing influence o'er man
enthusiasm is upon the mind;
softening and beautifying that which is
too harsh and sullen in itself.
how much
i loved the painter's glorious art, which forms
a world like, but more beautiful than, this;
just catching nature in her happiest mood!
how drank i in fine poetry, which makes
the hearing passionate, fill'd with memories
which steal from out the past like rays from clouds!
and then the sweet songs of my native vale,
whose sweetness and whose softness call'd to mind
the perfume of the flowers, the purity
of the blue sky; oh, how they stirr'd my soul! —
amid the many golden gifts which heaven
has left, like portions of its light, on earth
none hath such influence as music hath.
the painter's hues stand visible before us
in power and beauty; we can trace the thoughts
which are the workings of the poet's mind:
but music is a mystery, and viewless
even when present, and is less man's act,
and less within his order; for the hand
that can call forth the tones, yet cannot tell
whither they go, or if they live or die,
when floated once beyond his feeble ear;
and then, as if it were an unreal thing,
the wind will sweep from the neglected strings
as rich a swell as ever minstrel drew. a poet's word, a painter's touch, will reach
the innermost recesses of the heart,
making the pulses throb in unison
with joy or grief, which we can analyse;
there is the cause for pleasure and for pain:
but music moves us, and we know not why;
we feel the tears, but cannot trace their source.
is it the language of some other state,
born of its memory?
for what can wake
the soul's strong instinct of another world,
like music?
well with sadness doth it suit
to hear the melancholy sounds decay,
and think (for thoughts are life's great human links,
and mingle with our feelings) even so
will the heart's wildest pulses sink to rest. how have i loved, when the red evening fill'd
our temple with its glory, first, to gaze
on the strange contrast of the crimson air,
lighted as if with passion, and flung back,
from silver vase and tripod rich with gems,
to the pale statues round, where human life
was not, but beauty was, which seem'd to have
apart existence from humanity:
then, to go forth where the tall waving pines
seem'd as behind them roll'd a golden sea
immortal and eternal; and the boughs,
that darkly swept between me and its light,
were fitting emblems of the worldly cares
that are the boundary between us and heaven;
meanwhile, the wind, a wilful messenger
lingering amid the flowers on his way,
at intervals swept past in melody,
the lutes and voices of the choral hymn
contending with the rose-breath on his wing!
perhaps it is these pleasures' chiefest charm,
they are so indefinable, so vague.
from earliest childhood all too well aware
of the uncertain nature of our joys,
it is delicious to enjoy, yet know
no after-consequence will be to weep.
pride misers with enjoyment, when we have
delight in things that are but of the mind:
but half humility when we partake
pleasures that are half wants, the spirit pines
and struggles in its fetters, and disdains
the low base clay to which it is allied.
but here our rapture raises us: we feel
what glorious power is given to man, and find
our nature's nobleness and attributes,
whose heaven is intellect; and we are proud
to think how we can love those things of earth
which are least earthly; and the soul grows pure
in this high communing, and more divine. this time of dreaming happiness pass'd by,
another spirit was within my heart;
i drank the maddening cup of praise, which grew
henceforth the fountain of my life; i lived
only in others' breath; a word, a look,
were of all influence on my destiny:
if praise they spoke, 'twas sunlight to my soul;
or censure, it was like the scorpion's sting. and yet a darker lesson was to learn —
the hollowness of each: that praise, which is
but base exchange of flattery; that blame,
given by cautious coldness, which still deems
'tis safest to depress; that mockery,
flinging shafts but to show its own keen aim;
that carelessness, whose very censure's chance;
and, worst of all, the earthly judgment pass'd
by minds whose native clay is unredeem'd
by aught of heaven, whose every thought falls foul
plague-spot on beauty which they cannot feel,
tainting all that it touches with itself.
o dream of fame, what hast thou been to me
but the destroyer of life's calm content!
i feel so more than ever, that thy sway
is weaken'd over me. once i could find
a deep and dangerous delight in thee;
but that is gone.
i am too much awake.
light has burst o'er me, but not morning's light;
'tis such light as will burst upon the tomb,
when all but judgment's over.
can it be,
that these fine impulses, these lofty thoughts,
burning with their own beauty, are but given
to make me the low slave of vanity,
heartless and humbled?
o my own sweet power,
surely thy songs are made for more than this!
what a worst waste of feeling and of life
have been the imprints of my roll of time,
too much, too long!
to what use have i turn'd
the golden gifts in which i pride myself?
they are profaned; with their pure ore i made
a temple resting only on the breath
of heedless worshippers.
alas! that ever
praise should have been what it has been to me —
the opiate of my heart.
yet i have dream'd
of things which cannot be; the bright, the pure,
that all of which the heart may only dream;
and i have mused upon my gift of song,
and deeply felt its beauty, and disdain'd
the pettiness of praise to which at times
my soul has bow'd; and i have scorn'd myself
for that my cheek could burn, my pulses beat
at idle words.
and yet it is in vain
for the full heart to press back every throb
wholly upon itself.
ay, fair as are
the visions of a poet's solitude,
there must be something more for happiness;
they seek communion.
it had seem'd to me
a miser's selfishness, had i not sought
to share with others those impassion'd thoughts,
like light, or hope, or love, in their effects.
when i have watch'd the stars write on the sky
in characters of light, have seen the moon
come like veiled priestess from the east,
while, like a hymn, the wind swell'd on mine ear,
telling soft tidings of eve's thousand flowers,
has it not been the transport of my lute
to find its best delight in sympathy?
alas! the idols which our hopes set up,
they are chaldean ones, half gold, half clay;
we trust we are deceived, we hope, we fear,
alike without foundation; day by day
some new illusion is destroyed, and life
gets cold and colder on towards its close.
just like the years which make it, some are check'd
by sudden blights in spring; some are dried up
by fiery summers; others waste away
in calm monotony of quiet skies,
and peradventure these may be the best:
they know no hurricanes, no floods that sweep
as a god's vengeance were upon each wave;
but then they have no ruby fruits, no flowers
shining in purple, and no lighted mines
of gold and diamond.
which is the best, —
beauty and glory, in a southern clime,
mingled with thunder, tempest; or the calm
of skies that scarcely change, which, at the least,
if much of shine they have not, have no storms?
i know not: but i know fair earth or sky
are self-consuming in their loveliness,
and the too radiant sun and fertile soil
in their luxuriance run themselves to waste,
and the green valley and the silver stream
become a sandy desert.
o! the mind,
too vivid in its lighted energies,
may read its fate in sunny araby.
how lives its beauty in each eastern tale,
its growth of spices, and its groves of balm!
they are exhausted; and what is it now?
a wild and burning wilderness.
alas!
for such similitude. too much this is
the fate of this world's loveliest and best.is there not a far people, who possess
mysterious oracles of olden time,
who say that this earth labours with a curse,
that it is fallen from its first estate,
and is now but the shade of what it was?
i do believe the tale.
i feel its truth
in my vain aspirations, in the dreams
that are revealings of another world,
more pure, more perfect than our weary one,
where day is darkness to the starry soul. o heart of mine! my once sweet paradise
of love and hope! how changed thou art to me!
i cannot count thy changes: thou hast lost
interest in the once idols of thy being;
they have departed, even as if wings
had borne away their morning; they have left
weariness, turning pleasure into pain,
and too sure knowledge of their hollowness. and that too is gone from me; that which was
my solitude's delight!
i can no more
make real existence of a shadowy world.
time was, the poet's song, the ancient tale,
were to me fountains of deep happiness,
for they grew visible in my lonely hours,
as things in which i had a deed and part;
their actual presence had not been more true:
but these are bubbling sparkles, that are found
but at the spring's first source.
ah! years may bring
the mind to its perfection, but no more
will those young visions live in their own light;
life's troubles stir life's waters all too much,
passions chase fancies, and though still we dream,
the colouring is from reality. farewell, my lyre! thou hast not been to me
all i once hoped.
what is the gift of mind,
but as a barrier to so much that makes
our life endurable, — companionship,
mingling affection, calm and gentle peace,
till the vex'd spirit seals with discontent
a league of sorrow and of vanity,
built on a future which will never be! and yet i would resign the praise that now
makes my cheek crimson, and my pulses beat,
could i but deem that when my hand is cold,
and my lip passionless, my songs would be
number'd mid the young poet's first delights;
read by the dark-eyed maiden in an hour
of moonlight, till her cheek shone with its tears;
and murmur'd by the lover when his suit
calls upon poetry to breathe of love.
i do not hope a sunshine burst of fame,
my lyre asks but a wreath of fragile flowers.
i have told passionate tales of breaking hearts,
of young cheeks fading even before the rose;
my songs have been the mournful history
of woman's tenderness and woman's tears;
i have touch'd but the spirit's gentlest chords, —
surely the fittest for my maiden hand; —
and in their truth my immortality. thou lovely and lone star, whose silver light,
like music o'er the waters, steals along
the soften'd atmosphere; pale star, to thee
i dedicate the lyre, whose influence
i would have sink upon the heart like thine.in such an hour as this, the bosom turns
back to its early feelings; man forgets
his stern ambition and his worldly cares,
and woman loathes the petty vanities
that mar her nature's beauty; like the dew,
shedding its sweetness o'er the sleeping flowers
till all their morning freshness is revived,
kindly affections, sad but yet sweet thoughts,
melt the cold eyes, long, long unused to weep.
o lute of mine, that i shall wake no more!
such tearful music, linger on thy strings,
consecrate unto sorrow and to love;
thy truth, thy tenderness, be all thy fame!

that is no country for old men. the young

i walk through the long schoolroom questioning;
a kind old nun in a white hood replies;
the children learn to cipher and to sing,
to study reading-books and history,
to cut and sew, be neat in everything
in the best modern way—the children's eyes
in momentary wonder stare upon
a sixty-year-old smiling public man.
i dream of a ledaean body, bent
above a sinking fire, a tale that she
told of a harsh reproof, or trivial event
that changed some childish day to tragedy—
told, and it seemed that our two natures blent
into a sphere from youthful sympathy,
or else, to alter plato's parable,
into the yolk and white of the one shell.
and thinking of that fit of grief or rage
i look upon one child or t'other there
and wonder if she stood so at that age—
for even daughters of the swan can share
something of every paddler's heritage—
and had that colour upon cheek or hair,
and thereupon my heart is driven wild:
she stands before me as a living child.
her present image floats into the mind—
did quattrocento finger fashion it
hollow of cheek as though it drank the wind
and took a mess of shadows for its meat?
and i though never of ledaean kind
had pretty plumage once—enough of that,
better to smile on all that smile, and show
there is a comfortable kind of old scarecrow.
what youthful mother, a shape upon her lap
honey of generation had betrayed,
and that must sleep, shriek, struggle to escape
as recollection or the drug decide,
would think her son, did she but see that shape
with sixty or more winters on its head,
a compensation for the pang of his birth,
or the uncertainty of his setting forth?
plato thought nature but a spume that plays
upon a ghostly paradigm of things;
solider aristotle played the taws
upon the bottom of a king of kings;
world-famous golden-thighed pythagoras
fingered upon a fiddle-stick or strings
what a star sang and careless muses heard:
old clothes upon old sticks to scare a bird.
both nuns and mothers worship images,
but those the candles light are not as those
that animate a mother's reveries,
but keep a marble or a bronze repose.
and yet they too break hearts—o presences
that passion, piety or affection knows,
and that all heavenly glory symbolise—
o self-born mockers of man's enterprise;
labour is blossoming or dancing where
the body is not bruised to pleasure soul,
nor beauty born out of its own despair,
nor blear-eyed wisdom out of midnight oil.
o chestnut tree, great rooted blossomer,
are you the leaf, the blossom or the bole?
o body swayed to music, o brightening glance,
how can we know the dancer from the dance?

my soul. i summon to the winding ancient stair;
set all your mind upon the steep ascent,
upon the broken, crumbling battlement,
upon the breathless starlit air,
upon the star that marks the hidden pole;
fix every wandering thought upon
that quarter where all thought is done:
who can distinguish darkness from the soul? my self. the consecrated blade upon my knees
is sato's ancient blade, still as it was,
still razor-keen, still like a looking-glass
unspotted by the centuries;
that flowering, silken, old embroidery, torn
from some court-lady's dress and round
the wooden scabbard bound and wound,
can, tattered, still protect, faded adorn.my soul. why should the imagination of a man
long past his prime remember things that are
emblematical of love and war?
think of ancestral night that can,
if but imagination scorn the earth
and intellect its wandering
to this and that and t'other thing,
deliver from the crime of death and birth.my self. montashigi, third of his family, fashioned it
five hundred years ago, about it lie
flowers from i know not what embroidery—
heart's purple—and all these i set
for emblems of the day against the tower
emblematical of the night,
and claim as by a soldier's right
a charter to commit the crime once more. my soul. such fullness in that quarter overflows
and falls into the basin of the mind
that man is stricken deaf and dumb and blind,
for intellect no longer knows
is from the ought, or knower from the known—
that is to say, ascends to heaven;
only the dead can be forgiven;
but when i think of that my tongue's a stone.
my self. a living man is blind and drinks his drop.
what matter if the ditches are impure?
what matter if i live it all once more?
endure that toil of growing up;
the ignominy of boyhood; the distress
of boyhood changing into man;
the unfinished man and his pain
brought face to face with his own clumsiness;
the finished man among his enemies?—
how in the name of heaven can he escape
that defiling and disfigured shape
the mirror of malicious eyes
casts upon his eyes until at last
he thinks that shape must be his shape?
and what's the good of an escape
if honour find him in the wintry blast?
i am content to live it all again
and yet again, if it be life to pitch
into the frog-spawn of a blind man's ditch,
a blind man battering blind men;
or into that most fecund ditch of all,
the folly that man does
or must suffer, if he woos
a proud woman not kindred of his soul.
i am content to follow to its source
every event in action or in thought;
measure the lot; forgive myself the lot!
when such as i cast out remorse
so great a sweetness flows into the breast
we must laugh and we must sing,
we are blest by everything,
everything we look upon is blest.

the unpurged images of day recede;

i have heard that hysterical women say
they are sick of the palette and fiddle-bow,
of poets that are always gay,
for everybody knows or else should know
that if nothing drastic is done
aeroplane and zeppelin will come out,
pitch like king billy bomb-balls in
until the town lie beaten flat.
all perform their tragic play,
there struts hamlet, there is lear,
that's ophelia, that cordelia;
yet they, should the last scene be there,
the great stage curtain about to drop,
if worthy their prominent part in the play,
do not break up their lines to weep.
they know that hamlet and lear are gay;
gaiety transfiguring all that dread.
all men have aimed at, found and lost;
black out; heaven blazing into the head:
tragedy wrought to its uttermost.
though hamlet rambles and lear rages,
and all the drop scenes drop at once
upon a hundred thousand stages,
it cannot grow by an inch or an ounce.
on their own feet they came, or on shipboard,
camel-back, horse-back, ass-back, mule-back,
old civilisations put to the sword.
then they and their wisdom went to rack:
no handiwork of callimachus
who handled marble as if it were bronze,
made draperies that seemed to rise
when sea-wind swept the corner, stands;
his long lamp chimney shaped like the stem
of a slender palm, stood but a day;
all things fall and are built again
and those that build them again are gay.
two chinamen, behind them a third,
are carved in lapis lazuli,
over them flies a long-legged bird
a symbol of longevity;
the third, doubtless a serving-man,
carries a musical instrument.
every discolouration of the stone,
every accidental crack or dent
seems a water-course or an avalanche,
or lofty slope where it still snows
though doubtless plum or cherry-branch
sweetens the little half-way house
those chinamen climb towards, and i
delight to imagine them seated there;
there, on the mountain and the sky,
on all the tragic scene they stare.
one asks for mournful melodies;
accomplished fingers begin to play.
their eyes mid many wrinkles, their eyes,
their ancient, glittering eyes, are gay.

swear by what the sages spoke round the mareotic lake
that the witch of atlas knew, spoke and set the cocks a-crow.
swear by those horsemen, by those women, complexion and form prove superhuman, that pale, long visaged company
that airs an immortality
completeness of their passions won; now they ride the wintry dawn
where ben bulben sets the scene.
here's the gist of what they mean.
many times man lives and die sbetween his two eternities, that of race and that of soul, and ancient ireland knew it all. whether man dies in his bed or the rifle knocks him dead,
a brief parting from those dear is the worst man has to fear. though grave-diggers' toil is long, sharp their spades, their muscle strong, they but thrust their buried men back in the human mind again.
you that mitchel's prayer have heard end war in our time, o lord! know that when all words are said and a man is fighting mad, something drops from eyes long blind he completes his partial mind, for an instant stands at ease, laughs aloud, his heart at peace, even the wisest man grows tense with some sort of violence before he can accomplish fate know his work or choose his mate.
poet and sculptor do the work nor let the modish painter shirk what his great forefathers did, bring the soul of man to god, make him fill the cradles right.
measurement began our might: forms a stark egyptian thought, forms that gentler phidias wrought.
michael angelo left a proof on the sistine chapel roof, where but half-awakened adam can disturb globe-trotting madam till her bowels are in heat, proof that there's a purpose set before the secret working mind: profane perfection of mankind.
quattrocento put in paint,
on backgrounds for a god or saint, gardens where a soul's at ease; where everything that meets the eye
flowers and grass and cloudless sky resemble forms that are, or seem when sleepers wake and yet still dream, and when it's vanished still declare, with only bed and bedstead there, that heavens had opened.
gyres run on;
when that greater dream had gone calvert and wilson, blake and claude prepared a rest for the people of god, palmer's phrase, but after that
confusion fell upon our thought.
irish poets learn your trade sing whatever is well made, scorn the sort now growing up all out of shape from toe to top,
their unremembering hearts and heads base-born products of base beds. sing the peasantry, and then hard-riding country gentlemen, the holiness of monks, and after porter-drinkers' randy laughter; sing the lords and ladies gay that were beaten into the clay through seven heroic centuries; cast your mind on other days that we in coming days may be still the indomitable irishry.
under bare ben bulben's head
in drumcliff churchyard yeats is laid, an ancestor was rector there

cast a cold eye on life, on death. horseman, pass by!

i sought a theme and sought for it in vain,
i sought it daily for six weeks or so.
maybe at last being but a broken man
i must be satisfied with my heart, although
winter and summer till old age began
my circus animals were all on show,
those stilted boys, that burnished chariot,
lion and woman and the lord knows what.
what can i but enumerate old themes,
first that sea-rider oisin led by the nose
through three enchanted islands, allegorical dreams,
vain gaiety, vain battle, vain repose,
themes of the embittered heart, or so it seems,
that might adorn old songs or courtly shows;
but what cared i that set him on to ride,
i, starved for the bosom of his fairy bride.
and then a counter-truth filled out its play,
`the countess cathleen' was the name i gave it,
she, pity-crazed, had given her soul away
but masterful heaven had intervened to save it.
i thought my dear must her own soul destroy
so did fanaticism and hate enslave it,
and this brought forth a dream and soon enough
this dream itself had all my thought and love.
and when the fool and blind man stole the bread
cuchulain fought the ungovernable sea;
heart mysteries there, and yet when all is said
it was the dream itself enchanted me:
character isolated by a deed
to engross the present and dominate memory.
players and painted stage took all my love
and not those things that they were emblems of.
those masterful images because complete
grew in pure mind but out of what began?
a mound of refuse or the sweepings of a street,
old kettles, old bottles, and a broken can,
old iron, old bones, old rags, that raving slut
who keeps the till. now that my ladder's gone
i must lie down where all the ladders start
in the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.

fair is my love, and cruel as she's fair: her brow shades frowns although her eyes are sunny, her smiles are lightning though her pride despair, and her disdains are gall, her favours honey; a modest maid, deck'd with a blush of honour, whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love, the wonder of all eyes that look upon her: sacred on earth, design'd a saint above. chastity and beauty, which were deadly foes, live reconciled friends within her brow; and had she pity to conjoin with those, then who had heard the plaints i utter now? for had she not been fair and thus unkind, my muse had slept, and none had known my mind.

an uphill path, sun-gleams between the showers,
where every beam that broke the leaden skylit other hills with fairer ways than ours;
some clustered graves where half our memories lie; and one grim shadow creeping ever nigh: and this was life. wherein we did another's burden seek,
the tired feet we helped upon the road, the hand we gave the weary and the weak,
the miles we lightened one another's load, when, faint to falling, onward yet we strode: this too was life. till, at the upland, as we turned to go
amid fair meadows, dusky in the night, the mists fell back upon the road below;
broke on our tired eyes the western light; the very graves were for a moment bright: and this was death.

purged, with the life they left, of all that makes life paltry and mean and small, in their new dedication charged with something heightened, enriched, enlarged, that lends a light to their lusty brows and a song to the rhythm of their trampling feet, these are the men that have taken vows, these are the hardy, the flower, the élite,—these are the men that are moved no more by the will to traffic and grasp and store and ring with pleasure and wealth and love the circles that self is the centre of; but they are moved by the powers that force the sea for ever to ebb and rise, that hold arcturus in his course, and marshal at noon in tropic skies the clouds that tower on some snow-capped chair and drift out over the peopled plain. they are big with the beauty of cosmic things. mark how their columns surge! they seem to follow the goddess with outspread wings that points toward glory, the soldier's dream. with bayonets bare and flags unfurled, they scale the summits of the world and fade on the farthest golden height in fair horizons full of light. comrades in arms there—friend or foe—that trod the perilous, toilsome trail through a world of ruin and blood and woe in the years of great decision—hail! friend or foe, it shall matter nought; this only matters, in fine: we fought. for we were young and in love or strife sought exultation and craved excess: to sound the wildest debauch in life we staked our youth and its loveliness. let idlers argue the right and wrong and weigh what merit our causes had. putting our faith in being strong—above the level of good and bad—for us, we battled and burned and killed because evolving nature willed, and it was our pride and boast to be the instruments of destiny. there was a stately drama writ by the hand that peopled the earth and air and set the stars in the infinite and made night gorgeous and morning fair, and all that had sense to reason knew that bloody drama must be gone through. some sat and watched how the action veered—waited, profited, trembled, cheered—we saw not clearly nor understood, but yielding ourselves to the master hand, each in his part as best he could, we played it through as the author planned.

as i came through the desert thus it was, as i came through the desert: all was black, in heaven no single star, on earth no track; a brooding hush without a stir or note, the air so thick it clotted in my throat; and thus for hours; then some enormous things swooped past with savage cries and clanking wings: but i strode on austere; no hope could have no fear. as i came through the desert thus it was, as i came through the desert: eyes of fire glared at me throbbing with a starved desire; the hoarse and heavy and carnivorous breath was hot upon me from deep jaws of death; sharp claws, swift talons, fleshless fingers cold plucked at me from the bushes, tried to hold: but i strode on austere; no hope could have no fear. as i came through the desert thus it was, as i came through the desert: lo you, there, that hillock burning with a brazen glare; those myriad dusky flames with points a-glow which writhed and hissed and darted to and fro; a sabbath of the serpents, heaped pell-mell for devil's roll-call and some fête of hell: yet i strode on austere; no hope could have no fear.as i came through the desert thus it was, as i came through the desert: meteors ran and crossed their javelins on the black sky-span; the zenith opened to a gulf of flame, the dreadful thunderbolts jarred earth's fixed frame: the ground all heaved in waves of fire that surged and weltered round me sole there unsubmerged: yet i strode on austere; no hope could have no fear.as i came through the desert thus it was, as i came through the desert: air once more, and i was close upon a wild sea-shore; enormous cliffs arose on either hand, the deep tide thundered up a league-broad strand; white foambelts seethed there, wan spray swept and flew; the sky broke, moon and stars and clouds and blue: and i strode on austere; no hope could have no fear. as i came through the desert thus it was, as i came through the desert: on the left the sun arose and crowned a broad crag-cleft; there stopped and burned out black, except a rim, a bleeding eyeless socket, red and dim; whereon the moon fell suddenly south-west, and stood above the right-hand cliffs at rest: still i strode on austere; no hope could have no fear. as i came through the desert thus it was, as i came through the desert: from the right a shape came slowly with a ruddy light; a woman with a red lamp in her hand, bareheaded and barefooted on that strand; o desolation moving with such grace! o anguish with such beauty in thy face. i fell as on my bier, hope travailed with such fear. as i came through the desert thus it was, as i came through the desert: i was twain, two selves distinct that cannot join again; one stood apart and knew but could not stir, and watched the other stark in swoon and her; and she came on, and never turned aside, between such sun and moon and roaring tide: and as she came more near my soul grew mad with fear. as i came through the desert thus it was, as i came through the desert: hell is mild and piteous matched with that accursèd wild; a large black sign was on her breast that bowed, a broad black band ran down her snow-white shroud; that lamp she held was her own burning heart, whose blood-drops trickled step by step apart; the mystery was clear; mad rage had swallowed fear. as i came through the desert thus it was, as i came through the desert: by the sea she knelt and bent above that senseless me; those lamp-drops fell upon my white brow there, she tried to cleanse them with her tears and hair; she murmured words of pity, love, and woe, she heeded not the level rushing flow: and mad with rage and fear, i stood stonebound so near. as i came through the desert thus it was, as i came through the desert: when the tide swept up to her there kneeling by my side, she clasped that corpse-like me, and they were borne away, and this vile me was left forlorn; i know the whole sea cannot quench that heart, or cleanse that brow, or wash those two apart: they love; their doom is drear, yet they nor hope nor fear; but i, what do i here?

high on a throne of royal state, which far outshon the wealth of ormus and of ind, or where the gorgeous east with richest hand showrs on her kings barbaric pearl and gold, satan exalted sat, by merit rais'd to that bad eminence; and from despair thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue vain warr with heav'n, and by success untaught his proud imaginations thus displaid. powers and dominions, deities of heav'n, for since no deep within her gulf can hold immortal vigor, though opprest and fall'n, i give not heav'n for lost.
from this descent celestial vertues rising, will appear more glorious and more dread then from no fall, and trust themselves to fear no second fate: mee though just right, and the fixt laws of heav'n did first create your leader, next free choice, with what besides, in counsel or in fight, hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss thus farr at least recover'd, hath much more establisht in a safe unenvied throne yielded with full consent.
the happier state in heav'n, which follows dignity, might draw envy from each inferior; but who here will envy whom the highest place exposes formost to stand against the thunderers aim your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share of endless pain? where there is then no good for which to strive, no strife can grow up there from faction; for none sure will claim in hell precedence, none, whose portion is so small of present pain, that with ambitious mind will covet more.
with this advantage then to union, and firm faith, and firm accord, more then can be in heav'n, we now return to claim our just inheritance of old, surer to prosper then prosperity could have assur'd us; and by what best way, whether of open warr or covert guile, we now debate; who can advise, may speak. he ceas'd, and next him moloc, scepter'd king stood up, the strongest and the fiercest spirit that fought in heav'n; now fiercer by despair: his trust was with th' eternal to be deem'd equal in strength, and rather then be less car'd not to be at all; with that care lost went all his fear: of god, or hell, or worse he reck'd not, and these words thereafter spake. my sentence is for open warr: of wiles, more unexpert, i boast not: them let those contrive who need, or when they need, not now. for while they sit contriving, shall the rest, millions that stand in arms, and longing wait the signal to ascend, sit lingring here heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place accept this dark opprobrious den of shame, the prison of his tyranny who reigns by our delay? no, let us rather choose arm'd with hell flames and fury all at once o're heav'ns high towrs to force resistless way, turning our tortures into horrid arms against the torturer; when to meet the noise of his almighty engin he shall hear infernal thunder, and for lightning see black fire and horror shot with equal rage among his angels; and his throne it self mixt with tartarean sulphur, and strange fire, his own invented torments.
but perhaps the way seems difficult and steep to scale with upright wing against a higher foe. let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench of that forgetful lake benumm not still, that in our proper motion we ascend up to our native seat: descent and fall to us is adverse.
who but felt of late when the fierce foe hung on our brok'n rear insulting, and pursu'd us through the deep, with what compulsion and laborious flight we sunk thus low?
th' ascent is easie then; th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find to our destruction: if there be in hell fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be worse then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, condemn'd in this abhorred deep to utter woe; where pain of unextinguishable fire must exercise us without hope of end the vassals of his anger, when the scourge inexorably, and the torturing hour calls us to penance?
more destroy'd then thus we should be quite abolisht and expire. what fear we then? what doubt we to incense his utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd, will either quite consume us, and reduce to nothing this essential, happier farr then miserable to have eternal being: or if our substance be indeed divine, and cannot cease to be, we are at worst on this side nothing; and by proof we feel our power sufficient to disturb his heav'n, and with perpetual inrodes to allarme, though inaccessible, his fatal throne: which if not victory is yet revenge. he ended frowning, and his look denounc'd desperate revenge, and battel dangerous to less then gods.
on th' other side up rose belial, in act more graceful and humane; a fairer person lost not heav'n; he seemd for dignity compos'd and high exploit: but all was false and hollow; though his tongue dropt manna, and could make the worse appear the better reason, to perplex and dash maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low; to vice industrious, but to nobler deeds timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the ear, and with perswasive accent thus began. i should be much for open warr, o peers, as not behind in hate; if what was urg'd main reason to perswade immediate warr, did not disswade me most, and seem to cast ominous conjecture on the whole success: when he who most excels in fact of arms, in what he counsels and in what excels mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair and utter dissolution, as the scope of all his aim, after some dire revenge. first, what revenge? the towrs of heav'n are fill'd with armed watch, that render all access impregnable; oft on the bordering deep encamp thir legions, or with obscure wing scout farr and wide into the realm of night, scorning surprize.
or could we break our way by force, and at our heels all hell should rise with blackest insurrection, to confound heav'ns purest light, yet our great enemy all incorruptible would on his throne sit unpolluted, and th' ethereal mould incapable of stain would soon expel her mischief, and purge off the baser fire victorious. thus repuls'd, our final hope is flat despair: we must exasperate th' almighty victor to spend all his rage, and that must end us, that must be our cure, to be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, though full of pain, this intellectual being, those thoughts that wander through eternity, to perish rather, swallowd up and lost in the wide womb of uncreated night, devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, let this be good, whether our angry foe can give it, or will ever? how he can is doubtful; that he never will is sure. will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, belike through impotence, or unaware, to give his enemies thir wish, and end them in his anger, whom his anger saves to punish endless? wherefore cease we then? say they who counsel warr, we are decreed, reserv'd and destin'd to eternal woe; whatever doing, what can we suffer more, what can we suffer worse? is this then worst, thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms? what when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook with heav'ns afflicting thunder, and besought the deep to shelter us? this hell then seem'd a refuge from those wounds: or when we lay chain'd on the burning lake? that sure was worse. what if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage and plunge us in the flames? or from above should intermitted vengeance arm again his red right hand to plague us? what if all her stores were open'd, and this firmament of hell should spout her cataracts of fire impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall one day upon our heads; while we perhaps designing or exhorting glorious warr, caught in a fierie tempest shall be hurl'd each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk under yon boyling ocean, wrapt in chains; there to converse with everlasting groans, unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike my voice disswades; for what can force or guile with him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth all these our motions vain, sees and derides; not more almighty to resist our might then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. shall we then live thus vile, the race of heav'n thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here chains and these torments? better these then worse by my advice; since fate inevitable subdues us, and omnipotent decree, the victors will.
to suffer, as to doe, our strength is equal, nor the law unjust that so ordains: this was at first resolv'd, if we were wise, against so great a foe contending, and so doubtful what might fall. i laugh, when those who at the spear are bold and vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear what yet they know must follow, to endure exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, the sentence of thir conquerour: this is now our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, our supream foe in time may much remit his anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd not mind us not offending, satisfi'd with what is punish't; whence these raging fires will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames. our purer essence then will overcome thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel, or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd in temper and in nature, will receive familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; this horror will grow milde, this darkness light, besides what hope the never-ending flight of future dayes may bring, what chance, what change worth waiting, since our present lot appeers for happy though but ill, for ill not worst, if we procure not to our selves more woe. thus belial with words cloath'd in reasons garb counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, not peace: and after him thus mammon spake. either to disinthrone the king of heav'n we warr, if warr be best, or to regain our own right lost: him to unthrone we then may hope when everlasting fathe shall yeild to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife: the former vain to hope argues as vain the latter: for what place can be for us within heav'ns bound, unless heav'ns lord supream we overpower?
suppose he should relent and publish grace to all, on promise made of new subjection; with what eyes could we stand in his presence humble, and receive strict laws impos'd, to celebrate his throne with warbl'd hymns, and to his god head sing forc't halleluia's; while he lordly sits our envied sovran, and his altar breathes ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers, our servile offerings.
this must be our task in heav'n this our delight; how wearisom eternity so spent in worship paid to whom we hate.
let us not then pursue by force impossible, by leave obtain'd unacceptable, though in heav'n, our state of splendid vassalage, but rather seek our own good from our selves, and from our own live to our selves, though in this vast recess, free, and to none accountable, preferring hard liberty before the easie yoke of servile pomp.
our greatness will appeer then most conspicuous, when great things of small, useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse we can create, and in what place so e're thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain through labour and indurance.
this deep world of darkness do we dread? how oft amidst thick clouds and dark doth heav'ns all-ruling sire choose to reside, his glory unobscur'd, and with the majesty of darkness round covers his throne; from whence deep thunders roar must'ring thir rage, and heav'n resembles hell? as he our darkness, cannot we his light imitate when we please? this desart soile wants not her hidden lustre, gemms and gold; nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise magnificence; and what can heav'n shew more? our torments also may in length of time become our elements, these piercing fires as soft as now severe, our temper chang'd into their temper; which must needs remove the sensible of pain.
all things invite to peaceful counsels, and the settl'd state of order, how in safety best we may compose our present evils, with regard of what we are and were, dismissing quite all thoughts of warr: ye have what i advise. he scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld th' assembly, as when hollow rocks retain the sound of blustring winds, which all night long had rous'd the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull sea-faring men orewatcht, whose bark by chance or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay after the tempest:
such applause was heard as mammon ended, and his sentence pleas'd, advising peace: for such another field they dreaded worse then hell: so much the fear of thunder and the sword of michael wrought still within them; and no less desire to found this nether empire, which might rise by pollicy, and long process of time, in emulation opposite to heav'n. which when beelzebub perceiv'd, then whom, satan except, none higher sat, with grave aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd a pillar of state; deep on his front engraven deliberation sat and public care; and princely counsel in his face yet shon, majestic though in ruin: sage he stood with atlantean shoulders fit to bear the weight of mightiest monarchies; his look drew audience and attention still as night or summers noon-tide air, while thus he spake. thrones and imperial powers, off-spring of heav'n ethereal vertues; or these titles now must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd princes of hell? for so the popular vote inclines, here to continue, and build up here a growing empire; doubtless; while we dream, and know not that the king of heav'n hath doom'd this place our dungeon, not our safe retreat beyond his potent arm, to live exempt from heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new league banded against his throne, but to remaine in strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd, under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd his captive multitude: for he, be sure in heighth or depth, still first and last will reign sole king, and of his kingdom loose no part by our revolt, but over hell extend his empire, and with iron scepter rule us here, as with his golden those in heav'n. what sit we then projecting peace and warr? warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss irreparable; tearms of peace yet none voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n to us enslav'd, but custody severe, and stripes, and arbitrary punishment inflicted? and what peace can we return, but to our power hostility and hate, untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow, yet ever plotting how the conqueror least may reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce in doing what we most in suffering feel? nor will occasion want, nor shall we need with dangerous expedition to invade heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or siege, or ambush from the deep.
what if we find some easier enterprize? there is a place (if ancient and prophetic fame in heav'n err not) another world, the happy seat of some new race call'd man, about this time to be created like to us, though less in power and excellence, but favour'd more of him who rules above; so was his will pronounc'd among the gods, and by an oath, that shook heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd. thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn what creatures there inhabit, of what mould, or substance, how endu'd, and what thir power, and where thir weakness, how attempted best, by force or suttlety: though heav'n be shut, and heav'ns high arbitrator sit secure in his own strength, this place may lye expos'd the utmost border of his kingdom, left to their defence who hold it: here perhaps som advantagious act may be achiev'd by sudden onset, either with hell fire to waste his whole creation, or possess all as our own, and drive as we were driven, the punie habitants, or if not drive, seduce them to our party, that thir god may prove thir foe, and with repenting hand abolish his own works.
this would surpass common revenge, and interrupt his joy in our confusion, and our joy upraise in his disturbance; when his darling sons huri'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse thir frail original, and faded bliss, faded so soon.
advise if this be worth attempting, or to sit in darkness here hatching vain empires. thus beelzebub pleaded his devilish counsel, first devis'd by satan, and in part propos'd: for whence, but from the author of all ill could spring so deep a malice, to confound the race of mankind in one root, and earth with hell to mingle and involve, done all to spite the great creatour?
but thir spite still serves his glory to augment.
the bold design pleas'd highly those infernal states, and joy sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent they vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate, synod of gods, and like to what ye are, great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep will once more lift us up, in spight of fate, neerer our ancient seat; perhaps in view of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring arms and opportune excursion we may chance re-enter heav'n; or else in some milde zone dwell not unvisited of heav'ns fair light secure, and at the brightning orient beam purge off this gloom; the soft delicious air, to heal the scarr of these corrosive fires shall breathe her balme.
but first whom shall we send in search of this new world, whom shall we find sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet the dark unbottom'd infinite abyss and through the palpable obscure find out his uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight upborn with indefatigable wings over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive the happy ile; what strength, what art can then suffice, or what evasion bear him safe through the strict senteries and stations thick of angels watching round?
here he had need all circumspection, and we now no less choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, the weight of all and our last hope relies. this said, he sat; and expectation held his look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd to second, or oppose, or undertake the perilous attempt: but all sat mute, pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each in others count'nance read his own dismay astonisht: none among the choice and prime of those heav'n-warring champions could be found so hardie as to proffer or accept alone the dreadful voyage; till at last satan, whom now transcendent glory rais'd above his fellows, with monarchal pride conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake. o progeny of heav'n, empyreal thrones, with reason hath deep silence and demurr seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way and hard, that out of hell leads up to light; our prison strong, this huge convex of fire, outrageous to devour, immures us round ninefold, and gates of burning adamant barr'd over us prohibit all egress. these past, if any pass, the void profound of unessential night receives him next wide gaping, and with utter loss of being threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf. if thence he scape into whatever world, or unknown region, what remains him less then unknown dangers and as hard escape. but i should ill become this throne, o peers, and this imperial sov'ranty, adorn'd with splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd and judg'd of public moment, in the shape of difficulty or danger could deterr mee from attempting.
wherefore do i assume these royalties, and not refuse to reign, refusing to accept as great a share of hazard as of honour, due alike to him who reigns, and so much to him due of hazard more, as he above the rest high honourd sits? go therfore mighty powers, terror of heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home, while here shall be our home, what best may ease the present misery, and render hell more tollerable; if there be cure or charm to respite or deceive, or slack the pain of this ill mansion: intermit no watch against a wakeful foe, while i abroad through all the coasts of dark destruction seek deliverance for us all: this enterprize none shall partake with me.
thus saying rose the monarch, and prevented all reply, prudent, least from his resolution rais'd others among the chief might offer now (certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard; and so refus'd might in opinion stand his rivals, winning cheap the high repute which he through hazard huge must earn.
but they dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice forbidding; and at once with him they rose; thir rising all at once was as the sound of thunder heard remote. towards him they bend with awful reverence prone; and as a god extoll him equal to the highest in heav'n: nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd, that for the general safety he despis'd his own: for neither do the spirits damn'd loose all thir virtue; least bad men should boast thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, or clos ambition varnisht o're with zeal. thus they thir doubtful consultations dark ended rejoycing in thir matchless chief: as when from mountain tops the dusky clouds ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'respread heav'ns chearful face, the lowring element scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip snow, or showre; if chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive, the birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. o shame to men!
devil with devil damn'd firm concord holds, men onely disagree of creatures rational, though under hope of heavenly grace: and god proclaiming peace, yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife among themselves, and levie cruel warres, wasting the earth, each other to destroy: as if (which might induce us to accord) man had not hellish foes anow besides, that day and night for his destruction waite. the stygian counsel thus dissolv'd; and forth in order came the grand infernal peers, midst came thir mighty paramount, and seemd alone th' antagonist of heav'n, nor less than hells dread emperour with pomp supream, and god-like imitated state; him round a globe of fierie seraphim inclos'd with bright imblazonrie, and horrent arms. then of thir session ended they bid cry with trumpets regal sound the great result: toward the four winds four speedy cherubim put to thir mouths the sounding alchymie by haralds voice explain'd: the hollow abyss heard farr and wide, and all the host of hell with deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim. thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd by false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers disband, and wandring, each his several way pursues, as inclination or sad choice leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain the irksom hours, till this great chief return. part on the plain, or in the air sublime upon the wing, or in swift race contend, as at th' olympian games or pythian fields; part curb thir fierie steeds, or shun the goal with rapid wheels, or fronted brigads form. as when to warn proud cities warr appears wag'd in the troubl'd skie, and armies rush to battel in the clouds, before each van prick forth the aerie knights, and couch thir spears till thickest legions close; with feats of arms from either end of heav'n the welkin burns. others with vast typhoean rage more fell rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air in whirlwind; hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. as when alcides from oechalia crown'd with conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore through pain up by the roots thessalian pines, and lichas from the top of oeta threw into th' euboic sea.
others more milde, retreated in a silent valley, sing with notes angelical to many a harp thir own heroic deeds and hapless fall by doom of battel; and complain that fate free vertue should enthrall to force or chance. thir song was partial, but the harmony (what could it less when spirits immortal sing?) suspended hell, and took with ravishment the thronging audience.
in discourse more sweet (for eloquence the soul, song charms the sense,) others apart sat on a hill retir'd, in thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high of providence, foreknowledge, will and fate, fixt fate, free will, foreknowledg absolute, and found no end, in wandring mazes lost. of good and evil much they argu'd then, of happiness and final misery, passion and apathie, and glory and shame, vain wisdom all, and false philosophie: yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm pain for a while or anguish, and excite fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest with stubborn patience as with triple steel. another part in squadrons and gross bands, on bold adventure to discover wide that dismal world, if any clime perhaps might yield them easier habitation, bend four ways thir flying march, along the banks of four infernal rivers that disgorge into the burning lake thir baleful streams; abhorred styx the flood of deadly hate, sad acheron of sorrow, black and deep; cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud heard on the ruful stream; fierce phlegeton whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. farr off from these a slow and silent stream, lethe the river of oblivion roules her watrie labyrinth, whereof who drinks, forthwith his former state and being forgets, forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. beyond this flood a frozen continent lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, a gulf profound as that serbonian bog betwixt damiata and mount casius old, where armies whole have sunk: the parching air burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire. thither by harpy-footed furies hail'd, at certain revolutions all the damn'd are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, from beds of raging fire to starve in ice thir soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine immovable, infixt, and frozen round, periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. they ferry over this lethean sound both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, and wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach the tempting stream, with one small drop to loose in sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, all in one moment, and so neer the brink; but fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt medusa with gorgonian terror guards the ford, and of it self the water flies all taste of living wight, as once it fled the lip of tantalus.
thus roving on in confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous bands with shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast view'd first thir lamentable lot, and found no rest: through many a dark and drearie vaile they pass'd, and many a region dolorous, o're many a frozen, many a fierie alpe, rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death, a universe of death, which god by curse created evil, for evil only good, where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds, perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, abominable, inutterable, and worse than fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd, gorgons and hydra's, and chimera's dire. mean while the adversary of god and man, satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design, puts on swift wings, and towards the gates of hell explores his solitary flight; som times he scours the right hand coast, som times the left, now shaves with level wing the deep, then soares up to the fiery concave touring high. as when farr off at sea a fleet descri'd hangs in the clouds, by aequinoctial winds close sailing from bengala, or the iles of ternate and tidore, whence merchants bring thir spicie drugs: they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole.
so seem'd farr off the flying fiend: at last appeer hell bounds high reaching to the horrid roof, and thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass, three iron, three of adamantine rock, impenetrable, impal'd with circling fire, yet unconsum'd.
before the gates there sat on either side a formidable shape; the one seem'd woman to the waste, and fair, but ended foul in many a scaly fould voluminous and vast, a serpent arm'd with mortal sting: about her middle round a cry of hell hounds never ceasing bark'd with wide cerberian mouths full loud, and rung a hideous peal: yet, when they list, would creep, if aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb, and kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd, within unseen.
farr less abhorrd than these vex'd scylla bathing in the sea that parts calabria from the hoarce trinacrian shore: nor uglier follow the night-hag, when call'd in secret, riding through the air she comes lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance with lapland witches, while the labouring moon eclipses at thir charms.
the other shape, if shape it might be call'd that shape had none distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd, for each seem'd either; black it stood as night, fierce as ten furies, terrible as hell, and shook a dreadful dart; what seem'd his head the likeness of a kingly crown had on. satan was now at hand, and from his seat the monster moving onward came as fast with horrid strides, hell trembled as he strode. th' undaunted fiend what this might be admir'd, admir'd, not fear'd; god and his son except, created thing naught valu'd he nor shun'd; and with disdainful look thus first began. whence and what art thou, execrable shape, that dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance thy miscreated front athwart my way to yonder gates? through them i mean to pass, that be assur'd, without leave askt of thee: retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, hell-born, not to contend with spirits of heav'n. to whom the goblin full of wrauth reply'd, art thou that traitor angel, art thou hee, who first broke peace in heav'n and faith, till then unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious arms drew after him the third part of heav'ns sons conjur'd against the highest, for which both thou and they outcast from god, are here condemn'd to waste eternal dayes in woe and pain? and reck'n'st thou thy self with spirits of heav'n, hell-doom'd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn where i reign king, and to enrage thee more, thy king and lord?
back to thy punishment, false fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, least with a whip of scorpions i pursue thy lingring, or with one stroke of this dart strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. so spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, so speaking and so threatning, grew tenfold more dreadful and deform: on th' other side incenst with indignation satan stood unterrifi'd, and like a comet burn'd, that fires the length of ophiucus huge in th' artick sky, and from his horrid hair shakes pestilence and warr.
each at the head level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands no second stroke intend, and such a frown each cast at th' other, as when two black clouds with heav'ns artillery fraught, come rattling on over the caspian, then stand front to front hov'ring a space, till winds the signal blow to joyn thir dark encounter in mid air: so frownd the mighty combatants, that hell grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; for never but once more was either like to meet so great a foe: and now great deeds had been achiev'd, whereof all hell had rung, had not the snakie sorceress that sat fast by hell gate, and kept the fatal key, ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between. o father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd, against thy only son?
what fury o son, possesses thee to bend that mortal dart against thy fathers head? and know'st for whom; for him who sits above and laughs the while at thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute what e're his wrath, which he calls justice, bids, his wrath which one day will destroy ye both. she spake, and at her words the hellish pest forbore, then these to her satan return'd: so strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange thou interposest, that my sudden hand prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds what it intends; till first i know of thee, what thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why in this infernal vaile first met thou call'st me father, and that fantasm ca11'st my son? i know thee not, nor ever saw till now sight more detestable then him and thee. t' whom thus the portress of hell gate reply'd; hast thou forgot me then, and do i seem now in thine eyes so foul, once deemd so fair in heav'n, when at th' assembly, and in sight of all the seraphim with thee combin'd in bold conspiracy against heav'ns king, all on a sudden miserable pain surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm in darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide, likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright, then shining heav'nly fair, a goddess arm'd out of thy head i sprung: amazement seis'd all th' host of heav'n; back they recoild affraid at first, and call'd me sin, and for a sign portentous held me; but familiar grown, i pleas'd, and with attractive graces won the most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft thy self in me thy perfect image viewing becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st with me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd a growing burden.
mean while warr arose, and fields were fought in heav'n; wherein remaind (for what could else) to our almighty foe cleer victory, to our part loss and rout through all the empyrean: down they fell driv'n headlong from the pitch of heaven, down into this deep, and in the general fall i also; at which time this powerful key into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep these gates for ever shut, which none can pass without my op'ning.
pensive here i sat alone, but long i sat not, till my womb pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. at last this odious offspring whom thou seest thine own begotten, breaking violent way tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain distorted, all my nether shape thus grew transform'd: but he my inbred enemie forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal dart made to destroy: i fled, and cry'd out death; hell trembl'd at the hideous name, and sigh'd from all her caves, and back resounded death. i fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems, inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far, mee overtook his mother all dismaid, and in embraces forcible and foule ingendring with me, of that rape begot these yelling monsters that with ceasless cry surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd and hourly born, with sorrow infinite to me, for when they list into the womb that bred them they return, and howle and gnaw my bowels, thir repast; then bursting forth a fresh with conscious terrours vex me round, that rest or intermission none i find. before mine eyes in opposition sits grim death my son and foe, who sets them on, and me his parent would full soon devour for want of other prey, but that he knows his end with mine involvd; and knows that i should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane, when ever that shall be; so fate pronounc'd. but thou o father, i forewarn thee, shun his deadly arrow; neither vainly hope to be invulnerable in those bright arms, though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint, save he who reigns above, none can resist. she finish'd, and the suttle fiend his lore soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. dear daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy sire, and my fair son here showst me, the dear pledge of dalliance had with thee in heav'n, and joys then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know i come no enemie, but to set free from out this dark and dismal house of pain, both him and thee, and all the heav'nly host of spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd fell with us from on high: from them i go this uncouth errand sole, and one for all my self expose, with lonely steps to tread th' unfounded deep, and through the void immense to search with wandring quest a place foretold should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now created vast and round, a place of bliss in the pourlieues of heav'n, and therein plac't a race of upstart creatures, to supply perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd, least heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude might hap to move new broiles: be this or aught then this more secret now design'd, i haste to know, and this once known, shall soon return, and bring ye to the place where thou and death shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen wing silently the buxom air, imbalm'd with odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. he ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and death grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear his famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd his mother bad, and thus bespake her sire. the key of this infernal pit by due, and by command of heav'ns all-powerful king i keep, by him forbidden to unlock these adamantine gates; against all force death ready stands to interpose his dart, fearless to be o'rmatcht by living might. but what ow i to his commands above who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down into this gloom of tartarus profound, to sit in hateful office here confin'd, inhabitant of heav'n, and heav'nlie-born, here in perpetual agonie and pain, with terrors and with clamors compasst round of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: thou art my father, thou my author, thou my being gav'st me; whom should i obey but thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon to that new world of light and bliss, among the gods who live at ease, where i shall reign at thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems thy daughter and thy darling, without end. thus saying, from her side the fatal key, sad instrument of all our woe, she took; and towards the gate rouling her bestial train, forthwith the huge porcullis high up drew, which but her self not all the stygian powers could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns th' intricate wards, and every bolt and bar of massie iron or sollid rock with ease unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie with impetuous recoile and jarring sound th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges grate harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook of erebus.
she op'nd, but to shut excel'd her power; the gates wide op'n stood, that with extended wings a bannerd host under spread ensigns marching might pass through with horse and chariots rankt in loose array; so wide they stood, and like a furnace mouth cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. before thir eyes in sudden view appear the secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark illimitable ocean without bound, without dimension, where length, breadth, & highth, and time and place are lost; where eldest night and chaos.
ancestors of nature, hold eternal anarchie, amidst the noise of endless warrs, and by confusion stand. for hot, cold, moist, and dry, four champions fierce strive here for maistrie, and to battel bring thir embryon atoms; they around the flag of each his faction, in thir several clanns, light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, swarm populous, unnumber'd as the sands of barca or cyrene's torrid soil, levied to side with warring winds, and poise thir lighter wings.
to whom these most adhere, hee rules a moment; chaos umpire sits, and by decision more imbroiles the fray by which he reigns: next him high arbiter chance governs all.
into this wilde abyss, the womb of nature and perhaps her grave, of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire, but all these in thir pregnant causes mixt confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight, unless th' almighty maker them ordain his dark materials to create more worlds, into this wild abyss the warie fiend stood on the brink of hell and look'd a while, pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith he had to cross.
nor was his eare less peal'd with noises loud and ruinous (to compare great things with small) then when bellona storms, with all her battering engines bent to rase som capital city; or less then if this frame of heav'n were falling, and these elements in mutinie had from her axle torn the stedfast earth.
at last his sail-broad vannes he spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a league as in a cloudy chair ascending rides audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets a vast vacuitie: all unawares fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour down had been falling, had not by ill chance the strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud instinct with fire and nitre hurried him as many miles aloft: that furie stay'd, quencht in a boggie syrtis, neither sea, nor good dry land: nigh founderd on he fares, treading the crude consistence, half on foot, half flying; behoves him now both oare and saile. as when a gryfon through the wilderness with winged course ore hill or moarie dale, pursues the arimaspian, who by stelth had from his wakeful custody purloind the guarded gold: so eagerly the fiend ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, with head, hands, wings or feet pursues his way, and swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: at length a universal hubbub wilde of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd born through the hollow dark assaults his eare with loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, undaunted to meet there what ever power or spirit of the nethermost abyss might in that noise reside, of whom to ask which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes bordering on light; when strait behold the throne of chaos, and his dark pavilion spread wide on the wasteful deep; with him enthron'd sat sable-vested night, eldest of things, the consort of his reign; and by them stood orcus and ades, and the dreaded name of demogorgon; rumor next and chance, and tumult and confusion all imbroild, and discord with a thousand various mouths. t' whom satan turning boldly, thus. ye powers and spirits of this nethermost abyss, chaos and ancient night, i come no spy, with purpose to explore or to disturb the secrets of your realm, but by constraint wandring this darksome desart, as my way, lies through your spacious empire up to light, alone, and without guide, half lost, i seek what readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds confine with heav'n; or if som other place from your dominion won, th' ethereal king possesses lately, thither to arrive i travel this profound, direct my course; directed no mean recompence it brings to your behoof, if i that region lost, all usurpation thence expell'd, reduce to her original darkness and your sway (which is my present journey) and once more erect the standard there of ancient night; yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge. thus satan; and him thus the anarch old with faultring speech and visage incompos'd answer'd. i know thee, stranger, who thou art, that mighty leading angel, who of late made head against heav'ns king, though overthrown. i saw and heard, for such a numerous host fled not in silence through the frighted deep with ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, confusion worse confounded; and heav'n gates pourd out by millions her victorious bands pursuing.
i upon my frontieres here keep residence; if all i can will serve, that little which is left so to defend, encroacht on still through our intestine broiles weakning the scepter of old night: first hell your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; now lately heaven and earth, another world hung ore my realm, link'd in a golden chain to that side heav'n from whence your legions fell: if that way be your walk, you have not farr; so much the neerer danger; go and speed; havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. he ceas'd; and satan staid not to reply, but glad that now his sea should find a shore, with fresh alacritie and force renew'd springs upward like a pyramid of fire into the wilde expanse, and through the shock of fighting elements, on all sides round environ'd wins his way; harder beset and more endanger'd, then when argo pass'd through bosporus betwixt the justling rocks: or when ulysses on the larbord shunnd charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steard. so he with difficulty and labour hard mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee; but hee once past, soon after when man fell, strange alteration!
sin and death amain following his track, such was the will of heav'n, pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way over the dark abyss, whose boiling gulf tamely endur'd a bridge of wondrous length from hell continu'd reaching th' utmost orbe of this frail world; by which the spirits perverse with easie intercourse pass to and fro to tempt or punish mortals, except whom god and good angels guard by special grace. but now at last the sacred influence of light appears, and from the walls of heav'n shoots farr into the bosom of dim night a glimmering dawn; here nature first begins her fardest verge, and chaos to retire as from her outmost works a brok'd foe with tumult less and with less hostile din, that satan with less toil, and now with ease wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light and like a weather-beaten vessel holds gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn; or in the emptier waste, resembling air, weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold farr off th' empyreal heav'n, extended wide in circuit, undetermind square or round, with opal towrs and battlements adorn'd of living saphire, once his native seat; and fast by hanging in a golden chain this pendant world, in bigness as a starr of smallest magnitude close by the moon. thither full fraught with mischievous revenge, accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.

<|startoftext|>
hail holy light, ofspring of heav'n first-born, or of th' eternal coeternal beam may i express thee unblam'd? since god is light, and never but in unapproached light dwelt from eternitie, dwelt then in thee, bright effluence of bright essence increate. or hear'st thou rather pure ethereal stream, whose fountain who shall tell? before the sun, before the heavens thou wert, and at the voice of god, as with a mantle didst invest the rising world of waters dark and deep, won from the void and formless infinite. thee i re-visit now with bolder wing, escap't the stygian pool, though long detain'd in that obscure sojourn, while in my flight through utter and through middle darkness borne with other notes then to th' orphean lyre i sung of chaos and eternal night, taught by the heav'nly muse to venture down the dark descent, and up to reascend, though hard and rare: thee i revisit safe, and feel thy sovran vital lamp; but thou revisit'st not these eyes, that rowle in vain to find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn; so thick a drop serene hath quencht thir orbs, or dim suffusion veild.
yet not the more cease i to wander where the muses haunt cleer spring, or shadie grove, or sunnie hill, smit with the love of sacred song; but chief thee sion and the flowrie brooks beneath that wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow, nightly i visit: nor somtimes forget those other two equal'd with me in fate, so were i equal'd with them in renown, blind thamyris and blind maeonides, and tiresias and phineus prophets old. then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid tunes her nocturnal note.
thus with the year seasons return, but not to me returns day, or the sweet approach of ev'n or morn, or sight of vernal bloom, or summers rose, or flocks, or heards, or human face divine; but cloud in stead, and ever-during dark surrounds me, from the chearful wayes of men cut off, and for the book of knowledg fair presented with a universal blanc of natures works to mee expung'd and ras'd, and wisdome at one entrance quite shut out. so much the rather thou celestial light shine inward, and the mind through all her powers irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence purge and disperse, that i may see and tell of things invisible to mortal sight. now had the almighty father from above, from the pure empyrean where he sits high thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye, his own works and their works at once to view: about him all the sanctities of heaven stood thick as starrs, and from his sight receiv'd beatitude past utterance; on his right the radiant image of his glory sat, his onely son; on earth he first beheld our two first parents, yet the onely two of mankind, in the happie garden plac't, reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, uninterrupted joy, unrivald love in blissful solitude; he then survey'd hell and the gulf between, and satan there coasting the wall of heav'n on this side night in the dun air sublime, and ready now to stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet on the bare outside of this world, that seem'd firm land imbosom'd without firmament, uncertain which, in ocean or in air. him god beholding from his prospect high, wherein past, present, future he beholds, thus to his onely son foreseeing spake. onely begotten son, seest thou what rage transports our adversarie, whom no bounds prescrib'd, no barrs of hell, nor all the chains heapt on him there, nor yet the main abyss wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems on desparate reveng, that shall redound upon his own rebellious head.
and now through all restraint broke loose he wings his way not farr off heav'n, in the precincts of light, directly towards the new created world, and man there plac't, with purpose to assay if him by force he can destroy, or worse, by some false guile pervert; and shall pervert for man will hark'n to his glozing lyes, and easily transgress the sole command, sole pledge of his obedience: so will fall, hee and his faithless progenie: whose fault? whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee all he could have; i made him just and right, sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. such i created all th' ethereal powers and spirits, both them who stood and them who faild; freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. not free, what proof could they have givn sincere of true allegiance, constant faith or love, where onely what they needs must do, appeard, not what they would? what praise could they receive? what pleasure i from such obedience paid, when will and reason (reason also is choice) useless and vain, of freedom both despoild, made passive both, had servd necessitie, not mee.
they therefore as to right belongd, so were created, nor can justly accuse thir maker, or thir making, or thir fate, as if predestination over-rul'd thir will, dispos'd by absolute decree or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed thir own revolt, not i: if i foreknew, foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, which had no less prov'd certain unforeknown. so without least impulse or shadow of fate, or aught by me immutablie foreseen, they trespass, authors to themselves in all both what they judge and what they choose; for so i formd them free, and free they must remain, till they enthrall themselves: i else must change thir nature, and revoke the high decree unchangeable, eternal, which ordain'd thir freedom, they themselves ordain'd thir fall. the first sort by thir own suggestion fell, self-tempted, self-deprav'd: man falls deceiv'd by the other first: man therefore shall find grace, the other none: in mercy and justice both, through heav'n and earth, so shall my glorie excel, but mercy first and last shall brightest shine. thus while god spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd all heav'n, and in the blessed spirits elect sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd: beyond compare the son of god was seen most glorious, in him all his father shon substantially express'd, and in his face divine compassion visibly appeerd, love without end, and without measure grace, which uttering thus he to his father spake. o father, gracious was that word which clos'd thy sovran sentence, that man should find grace; for which both heav'n and earth shall high extoll thy praises, with th' innumerable sound of hymns and sacred songs, wherewith thy throne encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest. for should man finally be lost, should man thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest son fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd with his own folly? that be from thee farr, that farr be from thee, father, who art judg of all things made, and judgest onely right. or shall the adversarie thus obtain his end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill his malice, and thy goodness bring to naught, or proud return though to his heavier doom, yet with revenge accomplish't and to hell draw after him the whole race of mankind, by him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self abolish thy creation, and unmake, for him, what for thy glorie thou hast made? so should thy goodness and thy greatness both be questiond and blaspheam'd without defence. to whom the great creatour thus reply'd. o son, in whom my soul hath chief delight, son of my bosom, son who art alone my word, my wisdom, and effectual might, all hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are, all as my eternal purpose hath decreed: man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will, yet not of will in him, but grace in me freely voutsaft; once more i will renew his lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall'd by sin to foul exorbitant desires; upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand on even ground against his mortal foe, by me upheld, that he may know how frail his fall'n condition is, and to me ow all his deliv'rance, and to none but me. some i have chosen of peculiar grace elect above the rest; so is my will: the rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd thir sinful state, and to appease betimes th' incensed deitie, while offerd grace invites; for i will cleer thir senses dark, what may sufflce, and soft'n stonie hearts to pray, repent, and bring obedience due. to prayer, repentance, and obedience due, though but endevord with sincere intent, mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. and i will place within them as a guide my umpire conscience, whom if they will hear, light after light well us'd they shall attain, and to the end persisting, safe arrive. this my long sufferance and my day of grace they who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; but hard be hard'nd, blind be blinded more, that they may stumble on, and deeper fall; and none but such from mercy i exclude. but yet all is not don; man disobeying, disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns against the high supremacie of heav'n, affecting god-head, and so loosing all, to expiate his treason hath naught left, but to destruction sacred and devote, he with his whole posteritie must dye, dye hee or justice must; unless for him som other able, and as willing, pay the rigid satisfaction, death for death. say heav'nly powers, where shall we find such love, which of ye will be mortal to redeem mans mortal crime, and just th' unjust to save, dwels in all heaven charitie so deare? he ask'd, but all the heav'nly quire stood mute, and silence was in heav'n: on mans behalf patron or intercessor none appeerd, much less that durst upon his own head draw the deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. and now without redemption all mankind must have bin lost, adjudg'd to death and hell by doom severe, had not the son of god, in whom the fulness dwels of love divine, his dearest mediation thus renewd. father, thy word is past, man shall find grace; and shall grace not find means, that finds her way, the speediest of thy winged messengers, to visit all thy creatures, and to all comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought, happie for man, so coming; he her aide can never seek, once dead in sins and lost; attonement for himself or offering meet, indebted and undon, hath none to bring: behold mee then, mee for him, life for life i offer, on mee let thine anger fall; account mee man; i for his sake will leave thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee freely put off, and for him lastly dye well pleas'd, on me let death wreck all his rage; under his gloomie power i shall not long lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess life in my self for ever, by thee i live, though now to death i yield, and am his due all that of me can die, yet that debt paid, thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave his prey, nor suffer my unspotted soule for ever with corruption there to dwell; but i shall rise victorious, and subdue my vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile; death his deaths wound shall then receive, and stoop inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm'd. i through the ample air in triumph high shall lead hell captive maugre hell, and show the powers of darkness bound.
thou at the sight pleas'd, out of heaven shalt look down and smile, while by thee rais'd i ruin all my foes, death last, and with his carcass glut the grave: then with the multitude of my redeemd shall enter heaven long absent, and returne, father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud of anger shall remain, but peace assur'd, and reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire. his words here ended, but his meek aspect silent yet spake, and breath'd immortal love to mortal men, above which only shon filial obedience: as a sacrifice glad to be offer'd, he attends the will of his great father.
admiration seis'd all heav'n, what this might mean, and whither tend wondring; but soon th' almighty thus reply'd: o thou in heav'n and earth the only peace found out for mankind under wrauth, o thou my sole complacence! well thou know'st how dear, to me are all my works, nor man the least though last created, that for him i spare thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, by loosing thee a while, the whole race lost. thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem, thir nature also to thy nature joyn; and be thy self man among men on earth, made flesh, when time shall be, of virgin seed, by wondrous birth: be thou in adams room the head of all mankind, though adams son. as in him perish all men, so in thee as from a second root shall be restor'd, as many as are restor'd, without thee none. his crime makes guiltie all his sons, thy merit imputed shall absolve them who renounce thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, and live in thee transplanted, and from thee receive new life.
so man, as is most just, shall satisfie for man, be judg'd and die, and dying rise, and rising with him raise his brethren, ransomd with his own dear life. so heav'nly love shall outdoo hellish hate giving to death, and dying to redeeme, so dearly to redeem what hellish hate so easily destroy'd, and still destroyes in those who, when they may, accept not grace. nor shalt thou by descending to assume mans nature, less'n or degrade thine owne. because thou hast, though thron'd in highest bliss equal to god, and equally enjoying god-like fruition, quitted all to save a world from utter loss, and hast been found by merit more then birthright son of god, found worthiest to be so by being good, farr more then great or high; because in thee love hath abounded more then glory abounds, therefore thy humiliation shall exalt with thee thy manhood also to this throne; here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt reign both god and man, son both of god and man, anointed universal king, all power i give thee, reign for ever, and assume thy merits; under thee as head supream thrones, princedoms, powers, dominions i reduce: all knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide in heaven, or earth, or under earth in hell; when thou attended gloriously from heav'n shalt in the sky appeer, and from thee send the summoning arch-angels to proclaime thy dread tribunal: forthwith from all windes the living, and forthwith the cited dead of all past ages to the general doom shall hast'n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep. then all thy saints assembl'd, thou shalt judge bad men and angels, they arraignd shall sink beneath thy sentence; hell, her numbers full, thenceforth shall be for ever shut.
mean while the world shall burn, and from her ashes spring new heav'n and earth, wherein the just shall dwell, and after all thir tribulations long see golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, with joy and love triumphing, and fair truth. then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by, for regal scepter then no more shall need, god shall be all in all.
but all ye gods, adore him, who to compass all this dies, adore the son, and honour him as mee. no sooner had th' almighty ceas't, but all the multitude of angels with a shout loud as from numbers without number, sweet as from blest voices, uttering joy, heav'n rung with jubilee, and loud hosanna's filld th' eternal regions: lowly reverent towards either throne they bow, and to the ground with solemn adoration down they cast thir crowns inwove with amarant and gold, immortal amarant, a flour which once in paradise, fast by the tree of life began to bloom, but soon for mans offence to heav'n remov'd where first it grew, there grows, and flours aloft shading the fount of life, and where the river of bliss through midst of heavn rowls o're elisian flours her amber stream; with these that never fade the spirits elect bind thir resplendent locks inwreath'd with beams, now in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright pavement that like a sea of jasper shon impurpl'd with celestial roses smil'd. then crown'd again thir gold'n harps they took, harps ever tun'd, that glittering by thir side like quivers hung, and with praeamble sweet of charming symphonie they introduce thir sacred song, and waken raptures high; no voice exempt, no voice but well could joine melodious part, such concord is in heav'n. thee father first they sung omnipotent, immutable, immortal, infinite, eternal king; thee author of all being, fountain of light, thy self invisible amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st thron'd inaccessible, but when thou shad'st the full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine, dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer, yet dazle heav'n, that brightest seraphim approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes. thee next they sang of all creation first, begotten son, divine similitude, in whose conspicuous count'nance, without cloud made visible, th' almighty father shines, whom else no creature can behold; on thee impresst the effulgence of his glorie abides, transfus'd on thee his ample spirit rests. hee heav'n of heavens and all the powers therein by thee created, and by thee threw down th' aspiring dominations: thou that day thy fathers dreadful thunder didst not spare, nor stop thy flaming chariot wheels, that shook heav'ns everlasting frame, while o're the necks thou drov'st of warring angels disarraid. back from pursuit thy powers with loud acclaime thee only extoll'd, son of thy fathers might, to execute fierce vengeance on his foes, not so on man; him through their malice fall'n, father of mercie and grace, thou didst not doome so strictly, but much more to pitie encline: no sooner did thy dear and onely son perceive thee purpos'd not to doom frail man so strictly, but much more to pitie enclin'd, he to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife of mercy and justice in thy face discern'd, regardless of the bliss wherein hee sat second to thee, offerd himself to die for mans offence.
o unexampl'd love, love no where to be found less then divine! hail son of god, saviour of men, thy name shall be the copious matter of my song henceforth, and never shall my harp thy praise forget, nor from thy fathers praise disjoine. thus they in heav'n, above the starry sphear, thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent. mean while upon the firm opacous globe of this round world, whose first convex divides the luminous inferior orbs, enclos'd from chaos and th' inroad of darkness old, satan alighted walks: a globe farr off it seem'd, now seems a boundless continent dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of night starless expos'd, and ever-threatning storms of chaos blustring round, inclement skie; save on that side which from the wall of heav'n though distant farr som small reflection gaines of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud: here walk'd the fiend at large in spacious field. as when a vultur on imaus bred, whose snowie ridge the roving tartar bounds, dislodging from a region scarce of prey to gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids on hills where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs of ganges or hydaspes, indian streams; but in his way lights on the barren plaines of sericana, where chineses drive with sails and wind thir canie waggons light: so on this windie sea of land, the fiend walk'd up and down alone bent on his prey, alone, for other creature in this place living or liveless to be found was none, none yet, but store hereafter from the earth up hither like aereal vapours flew of all things transitorie and vain, when sin with vanity had filld the works of men: both all things vain, and all who in vain things built thir fond hopes of glorie or lasting fame, or happiness in this or th' other life; all who have thir reward on earth, the fruits of painful superstition and blind zeal, naught seeking but the praise of men, here find fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds; all th, unaccomplisht works of natures hand, abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt, dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain, till final dissolution, wander here, not in the neighbouring moon, as some have dreamd; those argent fields more likely habitants, translated saints, or middle spirits hold betwixt th' angelical and human kinde: hither of ill-joynd sons and daughters born first from the ancient world those giants came with many a vain exploit, though then renownd: the builders next of babel on the plain of sennaar, and still with vain designe new babels, had they wherewithall, would build: others came single; he who to be deemd a god, leap'd fondly into aetna flames, empedocles, and hee who to enjoy plato's elysium, leap'd into the sea, cleombrotus, and many more too long, embryo's and idiots, eremits and friers white, black and grey, with all thir trumperie. here pilgrims roam, that stray'd so farr to seek in golgotha him dead, who lives in heav'n; and they who to be sure of paradise dying put on the weeds of dominic, or in franciscan think to pass disguis'd; they pass the planets seven, and pass the fixt, and that crystalline sphear whose ballance weighs the trepidation talkt, and that first mov'd; and now saint peter at heav'ns wicket seems to wait them with his keys, and now at foot of heav'ns ascent they lift thir feet, when loe a violent cross wind from either coast blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry into the devious air; then might ye see cowles, hoods and habits with thir wearers tost and flutterd into raggs, then reliques, beads, indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls, the sport of winds: all these upwhirld aloft fly o're the backside of the world farr off into a limbo large and broad, since calld the paradise of fools, to few unknown long after, now unpeopl'd, and untrod; all this dark globe the fiend found as he pass'd, and long he wanderd, till at last a gleame of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste his travell'd steps; farr distant he descries ascending by degrees magnificent up to the wall of heaven a structure high, at top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd the work as of a kingly palace gate with frontispice of diamond and gold imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient gemmes the portal shon, inimitable on earth by model, or by shading pencil drawn. the stairs were such as whereon jacob saw angels ascending and descending, bands of guardians bright, when he from esau fled to padan-aram in the field of luz, dreaming by night under the open skie, and waking cri'd, this is the gate of heav'n. each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood there alwayes, but drawn up to heav'n somtimes viewless, and underneath a bright sea flow'd of jasper, or of liquid pearle, whereon who after came from earth, sayling arriv'd, wafted by angels, or flew o're the lake rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds. the stairs were then let down, whether to dare the fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate his sad exclusion from the dores of bliss. direct against which op'nd from beneath, just o're the blissful seat of paradise, a passage down to th' earth, a passage wide, wider by farr then that of after-times over mount sion, and, though that were large, over the promis'd land to god so dear, by which, to visit oft those happy tribes, on high behests his angels to and fro pass'd frequent, and his eye with choice regard from paneas the fount of jordans flood to beersaba, where the holy land borders on aegypt and the arabian shoare; so wide the op'ning seemd, where bounds were set to darkness, such as bound the ocean wave. satan from hence now on the lower stair that scal'd by steps of gold to heav'n gate looks down with wonder at the sudden view of all this world at once.
as when a scout through dark and desart wayes with peril gone all night; at last by break of chearful dawne obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill, which to his eye discovers unaware the goodly prospect of some forein land first-seen, or some renown'd metropolis with glistering spires and pinnacles adornd, which now the rising sun guilds with his beams. such wonder seis'd, though after heaven seen, the spirit maligne, but much more envy seis'd at sight of all this world beheld so faire. round he surveys, and well might, where he stood so high above the circling canopie of nights extended shade; from eastern point of libra to the fleecie starr that bears andromeda farr off atlantic seas beyond th' horizon; then from pole to pole he views in bredth, and without longer pause down right into the worlds first region throws his flight precipitant, and windes with ease through the pure marble air his oblique way amongst innumerable starrs, that shon stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other worlds, or other worlds they seemd, or happy iles, like those hesperian gardens fam'd of old, fortunate fields, and groves and flourie vales, thrice happy iles, but who dwelt happy there he stayd not to enquire: above them all the golden sun in splendor likest heaven allur'd his eye: thither his course he bends through the calm firmament; but up or downe by center, or eccentric, hard to tell, or longitude, where the great luminarie alooff the vulgar constellations thick, that from his lordly eye keep distance due, dispenses light from farr; they as they move thir starry dance in numbers that compute days, months, & years, towards his all-chearing lamp turn swift thir various motions, or are turnd by his magnetic beam, that gently warms the univers, and to each inward part with gentle penetration, though unseen, shoots invisible vertue even to the deep: so wondrously was set his station bright. there lands the fiend, a spot like which perhaps astronomer in the sun's lucent orbe through his glaz'd optic tube yet never saw. the place he found beyond expression bright, compar'd with aught on earth, medal or stone; not all parts like, but all alike informd with radiant light, as glowing iron with fire; if mettal, part seemd gold, part silver cleer; if stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite, rubie or topaz, to the twelve that shon in aarons brest-plate, and a stone besides imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, that stone, or like to that which here below philosophers in vain so long have sought, in vain, though by thir powerful art they binde volatil hermes, and call up unbound in various shapes old proteus from the sea, draind through a limbec to his native forme. what wonder then if fields and regions here breathe forth elixir pure, and rivers run potable gold, when with one vertuous touch th' arch-chimic sun so farr from us remote produces with terrestrial humor mixt here in the dark so many precious things of colour glorious and effect so rare? here matter new to gaze the devil met undazl'd, farr and wide his eye commands, for sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, but all sun-shine, as when his beams at noon culminate from th' aequator, as they now shot upward still direct, whence no way round shadow from body opaque can fall, and the aire, no where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray to objects distant farr, whereby he soon saw within kenn a glorious angel stand, the same whom john saw also in the sun: his back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; of beaming sunnie raies, a golden tiar circl'd his head, nor less his locks behind illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd he seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. glad was the spirit impure as now in hope to find who might direct his wandring flight to paradise the happie seat of man, his journies end and our beginning woe. but first he casts to change his proper shape, which else might work him danger or delay: and now a stripling cherube he appeers, not of the prime, yet such as in his face youth smil'd celestial, and to every limb sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feignd; under a coronet his flowing haire in curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with gold, his habit fit for speed succinct, and held before his decent steps a silver wand. he drew not nigh unheard, the angel bright, ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, admonisht by his ear, and strait was known th' arch-angel uriel, one of the seav'n who in gods presence, neerest to his throne stand ready at command, and are his eyes that run through all the heav'ns, or down to th' earth bear his swift errands over moist and dry, o're sea and land: him satan thus accostes; uriel, for thou of those seav'n spirits that stand in sight of god's high throne, gloriously bright, the first art wont his great authentic will interpreter through highest heav'n to bring, where all his sons thy embassie attend; and here art likeliest by supream decree like honour to obtain, and as his eye to visit oft this new creation round; unspeakable desire to see, and know all these his wondrous works, but chiefly man, his chief delight and favour, him for whom all these his works so wondrous he ordaind, hath brought me from the quires of cherubim alone thus wandring.
brightest seraph tell in which of all these shining orbes hath man his fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, but all these shining orbes his choice to dwell; that i may find him, and with secret gaze, or open admiration him behold on whom the great creator hath bestowd worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd; that both in him and all things, as is meet, the universal maker we may praise; who justly hath drivn out his rebell foes to deepest hell, and to repair that loss created this new happie race of men to serve him better: wise are all his wayes. so spake the false dissembler unperceivd; for neither man nor angel can discern hypocrisie, the onely evil that walks invisible, except to god alone, by his permissive will, through heav'n and earth: and oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps at wisdoms gate, and to simplicitie resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill where no ill seems: which now for once beguil'd uriel, though regent of the sun, and held the sharpest sighted spirit of all in heav'n; who to the fraudulent impostor foule in his uprightness answer thus returnd. fair angel, thy desire which tends to know the works of god, thereby to glorifie the great work-maister, leads to no excess that reaches blame, but rather merits praise the more it seems excess, that led thee hither from thy empyreal mansion thus alone, to witness with thine eyes what some perhaps contented with report hear onely in heav'n: for wonderful indeed are all his works, pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all had in remembrance alwayes with delight; but what created mind can comprehend thir number, or the wisdom infinite that brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. i saw when at his word the formless mass, this worlds material mould, came to a heap: confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd; till at his second bidding darkness fled, light shon, and order from disorder sprung: swift to thir several quarters hasted then the cumbrous elements, earth, flood, aire, fire, and this ethereal quintessence of heav'n flew upward, spirited with various forms, that rowld orbicular, and turnd to starrs numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; each had his place appointed, each his course, the rest in circuit walles this universe. look downward on that globe whose hither side with light from hence, though but reflected, shines; that place is earth the seat of man, that light his day, which else as th' other hemisphere night would invade, but there the neighbouring moon (so call that opposite fair starr) her aide timely interposes, and her monthly round still ending, still renewing, through mid heav'n; with borrowd light her countenance triform hence fills and empties to enlighten th' earth, and in her pale dominion checks the night. that spot to which i point is paradise, adams abode, those loftie shades his bowre. thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. thus said, he turnd, and satan bowing low, as to superior spirits is wont in heaven, where honour due and reverence none neglects, took leave, and toward the coast of earth beneath, down from th' ecliptic, sped with hop'd success, throws his steep flight in many an aerie wheele, nor staid, till on niphates top he lights.

o for that warning voice, which he who saw th' apocalyps, heard cry in heaven aloud, then when the dragon, put to second rout, came furious down to be reveng'd on men, wo to the inhabitants on earth! that now, while time was, our first-parents had bin warnd the coming of thir secret foe, and scap'd haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now satan, now first inflam'd with rage, came down, the tempter ere th' accuser of man-kind, to wreck on innocent frail man his loss of that first battel, and his flight to hell: yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold, far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest, and like a devillish engine back recoiles upon himself; horror and doubt distract his troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr the hell within him, for within him hell he brings, and round about him, nor from hell one step no more then from himself can fly by change of place: now conscience wakes despair that slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie of what he was, what is, and what must be worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. sometimes towards eden which now in his view lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad, sometimes towards heav'n and the full-blazing sun, which now sat high in his meridian towre: then much revolving, thus in sighs began. o thou that with surpassing glory crownd, look'st from thy sole dominion like the god of this new world; at whose sight all the starrs hide thir diminisht heads; to thee i call, but with no friendly voice, and add thy name o sun, to tell thee how i hate thy beams that bring to my remembrance from what state i fell, how glorious once above thy spheare; till pride and worse ambition threw me down warring in heav'n against heav'ns matchless king: ah wherefore! he deservd no such return from me, whom he created what i was in that bright eminence, and with his good upbraided none; nor was his service hard. what could be less then to afford him praise, the easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, how due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me, and wrought but malice; lifted up so high i sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher would set me highest, and in a moment quit the debt immense of endless gratitude, so burthensome still paying, still to ow; forgetful what from him i still receivd, and understood not that a grateful mind by owing owes not, but still pays, at once indebted and dischargd; what burden then? o had his powerful destiny ordaind me some inferiour angel, i had stood then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd ambition.
yet why not? som other power as great might have aspir'd, and me though mean drawn to his part; but other powers as great fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within or from without, to all temptations arm'd. hadst thou the same free will and power to stand? thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, but heav'ns free love dealt equally to all? be then his love accurst, since love or hate, to me alike, it deals eternal woe. nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will chose freely what it now so justly rues. me miserable! which way shall i flie infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? which way i flie is hell; my self am hell; and in the lowest deep a lower deep still threatning to devour me opens wide, to which the hell i suffer seems a heav'n. o then at last relent: is there no place left for repentance, none for pardon left? none left but by submission; and that word disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame among the spirits beneath, whom i seduc'd with other promises and other vaunts then to submit, boasting i could subdue th' omnipotent.
ay me, they little know how dearly i abide that boast so vaine, under what torments inwardly i groane; while they adore me on the throne of hell, with diadem and scepter high advanc'd the lower still i fall, onely supream in miserie; such joy ambition findes. but say i could repent and could obtaine by act of grace my former state; how soon would higth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay what feign'd submission swore: ease would recant vows made in pain, as violent and void. for never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep: which would but lead me to a worse relapse and heavier fall: so should i purchase deare short intermission bought with double smart. this knows my punisher; therefore as farr from granting hee, as i from begging peace: all hope excluded thus, behold in stead of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight, mankind created, and for him this world. so farwel hope, and with hope farwel fear, farwel remorse: all good to me is lost; evil be thou my good; by thee at least divided empire with heav'ns king i hold by thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne; as man ere long, and this new world shall know. thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair, which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid him counterfet, if any eye beheld. for heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule are ever cleer.
whereof hee soon aware, each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme, artificer of fraud; and was the first that practisd falshood under saintly shew, deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge: yet not anough had practisd to deceive uriel once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down the way he went, and on th' assyrian mount saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce he markd and mad demeanour, then alone, as he suppos'd, all unobserv'd, unseen. so on he fares, and to the border comes, of eden, where delicious paradise, now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green, as with a rural mound the champain head of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides with thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde, access deni'd; and over head up grew insuperable highth of loftiest shade, cedar, and pine, and firr, and branching palm, a silvan scene, and as the ranks ascend shade above shade, a woodie theatre of stateliest view.
yet higher then thir tops the verdurous wall of paradise up sprung: which to our general sire gave prospect large into his neather empire neighbouring round. and higher then that wall a circling row of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit, blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt: on which the sun more glad impress'd his beams then in fair evening cloud, or humid bow, when god hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd that lantskip: and of pure now purer aire meets his approach, and to the heart inspires vernal delight and joy, able to drive all sadness but despair: now gentle gales fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole those balmie spoiles.
as when to them who saile beyond the cape of hope, and now are past mozambic, off at sea north-east windes blow sabean odours from the spicie shoare of arabie the blest, with such delay well pleas'd they slack thir course, and many a league chear'd with the grateful smell old ocean smiles. so entertaind those odorous sweets the fiend who came thir bane, though with them better pleas'd then asmodeus with the fishie fume, that drove him, though enamourd, from the spouse of tobits son, and with a vengeance sent from media post to aegypt, there fast bound. now to th' ascent of that steep savage hill satan had journied on, pensive and slow; but further way found none, so thick entwin'd, as one continu'd brake, the undergrowth of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext all path of man or beast that past that way: one gate there only was, and that look'd east on th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt, at one slight bound high over leap'd all bound of hill or highest wall, and sheer within lights on his feet.
as when a prowling wolfe, whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, watching where shepherds pen thir flocks at eeve in hurdl'd cotes amid the field secure, leaps o're the fence with ease into the fould:. or as a thief bent to unhoord the cash of some rich burgher, whose substantial dores, cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, in at the window climbs, or o're the tiles; so clomb this first grand thief into gods fould: so since into his church lewd hirelings climbe. thence up he flew, and on the tree of life, the middle tree and highest there that grew, sat like a cormorant; yet not true life thereby regaind, but sat devising death to them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought of that life-giving plant, but only us'd for prospect, what well us'd had bin the pledge of immortality.
so little knows any, but god alone, to value right the good before him, but perverts best things to worst abuse, or to thir meanest use. beneath him with new wonder now he views to all delight of human sense expos'd in narrow room natures whole wealth, yea more, a heav'n on earth, for blissful paradise of god the garden was, by him in the east of eden planted; eden stretchd her line from auran eastward to the royal towrs of great seleucia, built by grecian kings, or where the sons of eden long before dwelt in telassar: in this pleasant soile his farr more pleasant garden god ordaind; out of the fertil ground he caus'd to grow all trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; and all amid them stood the tree of life, high eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit of vegetable gold; and next to life our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by, knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill. southward through eden went a river large, nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggie hill pass'd underneath ingulft, for god had thrown that mountain as his garden mould high rais'd upon the rapid current, which through veins of porous earth with kindly thirst up drawn, rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill waterd the garden; thence united fell down the steep glade, and met the neather flood, which from his darksom passage now appeers, and now divided into four main streams, runs divers, wandring many a famous realme and country whereof here needs no account, but rather to tell how, if art could tell, how from that saphire fount the crisped brooks, rowling on orient pearl and sands of gold, with mazie error under pendant shades ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed flours worthy of paradise which not nice art in beds and curious knots, but nature boon powrd forth profuse on hill and dale and plaine, both where the morning sun first warmly smote the open field, and where the unpierc't shade lmbround the noontide bowrs: thus was this place, a happy rural seat of various view; groves whose rich trees wept odorous gumms and balme, others whose fruit burnisht with golden rinde hung amiable, hesperian fables true, if true, here only, and of delicious taste: betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks grasing the tender herb, were interpos'd, or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap of som irriguous valley spred her store, flours of all hue, and without thorn the rose: another side, umbrageous grots and caves of coole recess, o're which the mantling vine layes forth her purple grape, and gently creeps luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall down the slope hills, disperst, or in a lake, that to the fringed bank with myrtle crownd, her chrystal mirror holds, unite thir streams. the birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires, breathing the smell of field and grove, attune the trembling leaves, while universal pan knit with the graces and the hours in dance led on th' eternal spring.
not that faire field of enna, where proserpin gathering flours her self a fairer floure by gloomie dis was gatherd, which cost ceres all that pain to seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove of daphne by orontes, and th' inspir'd castalian spring, might with this paradise of eden strive; nor that nyseian ile girt with the river triton, where old cham, whom gentiles ammon call and lybian jove, hid amalthea and her florid son young bacchus from his stepdame rhea's eye; nor where abassin kings thir issue guard, mount amara, though this by som suppos'd true paradise under the ethiop line by nilus head, enclosd with shining rock, a whole days journy high, but wide remote from this assyrian garden, where the fiend saw undelighted all delight, all kind of living creatures new to sight and strange: two of far nobler shape erect and tall, godlike erect, with native honour clad in naked majestie seemd lords of all, and worthie seemd, for in thir looks divine the image of thir glorious maker shon, truth, wisdome, sanctitude severe and pure, severe but in true filial freedom plac't; whence true autoritie in men; though both not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; for contemplation hee and valour formd, for softness shee and sweet attractive grace, hee for god only, shee for god in him: his fair large front and eye sublime declar'd absolute rule; and hyacinthin locks round from his parted forelock manly hung clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad: shee as a vail down to the slender waste her unadorned golden tresses wore dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd as the vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway, and by her yielded, by him best receivd, yielded with coy submission, modest pride, and sweet reluctant amorous delay. nor those mysterious parts were then conceald, then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame of natures works, honor dishonorable, sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind with shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, and banisht from mans life his happiest life, simplicitie and spotless innocence. so passd they naked on, nor shund the sight of god or angel, for they thought no ill: so hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair that ever since in loves imbraces met, adam the goodliest man of men since borne his sons, the fairest of her daughters eve. under a tuft of shade that on a green stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side they sat them down, and after no more toil of thir sweet gardning labour then suffic'd to recommend coole zephyr, and made ease more easie, wholsom thirst and appetite more grateful, to thir supper fruits they fell, nectarine fruits which the compliant boughes yielded them, side-long as they sat recline on the soft downie bank damaskt with flours: the savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream; nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial league, alone as they.
about them frisking playd all beasts of th' earth, since wilde, and of all chase in wood or wilderness, forrest or den; sporting the lion rampd, and in his paw dandl'd the kid; bears, tygers, ounces, pards, gambold before them, th' unwieldy elephant to make them mirth us'd all his might, and wreathd his lithe proboscis; close the serpent sly insinuating, wove with gordian twine his breaded train, and of his fatal guile gave proof unheeded; others on the grass coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat, or bedward ruminating: for the sun declin'd was hasting now with prone carreer to th' ocean iles, and in th' ascending scale of heav'n the starrs that usher evening rose: when satan still in gaze, as first he stood, scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad. o hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold, into our room of bliss thus high advanc't creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, not spirits, yet to heav'nly spirits bright little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue with wonder, and could love, so lively shines in them divine resemblance, and such grace the hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd. ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh your change approaches, when all these delights will vanish and deliver ye to woe, more woe, the more your taste is now of joy; happie, but for so happie ill secur'd long to continue, and this high seat your heav'n ill fenc't for heav'n to keep out such a foe as now is enterd; yet no purpos'd foe to you whom i could pittie thus forlorne though i unpittied: league with you i seek, and mutual amitie so streight, so close, that i with you must dwell, or you with me henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please like this fair paradise, your sense, yet such accept your makers work; he gave it me, which i as freely give; hell shall unfold, to entertain you two, her widest gates, and send forth all her kings; there will be room, not like these narrow limits, to receive ass your numerous ofspring; if no better place, thank him who puts me loath to this revenge on you who wrong me not for him who wrongd. and should i at your harmless innocence melt, as i doe, yet public reason just, honour and empire with revenge enlarg'd, by conquering this new world, compels me now to do what else though damnd i should abhorre. so spake the fiend, and with necessitie, the tyrants plea, excus'd his devilish deeds. then from his loftie stand on that high tree down he alights among the sportful herd of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one, now other, as thir shape servd best his end neerer to view his prey, and unespi'd to mark what of thir state he more might learn by word or action markt: about them round a lion now he stalkes with fierie glare, then as a tyger, who by chance hath spi'd in some purlieu two gentle fawnes at play, strait couches close, then rising changes oft his couchant watch, as one who chose his ground whence rushing he might surest seize them both grip't in each paw: when adam first of men to first of women eve thus moving speech, turnd him all eare to hear new utterance flow. sole partner and sole part of all these joyes, dearer thy self then all; needs must the power that made us, and for us this ample world be infinitly good, and of his good as liberal and free as infinite, that rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here in all this happiness, who at his hand have nothing merited, nor can performe aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires from us no other service then to keep this one, this easie charge, of all the trees in paradise that bear delicious fruit so various, not to taste that onely tree of knowledge, planted by the tree of life, so neer grows death to life, what ere death is, som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst god hath pronounc't it death to taste that tree, the only sign of our obedience left among so many signes of power and rule conferrd upon us, and dominion giv'n over all other creatures that possess earth, aire, and sea.
then let us not think hard one easie prohibition, who enjoy free leave so large to all things else, and choice unlimited of manifold delights: but let us ever praise him, and extoll his bountie, following our delightful task to prune these growing plants, and tend these flours, which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet. to whom thus eve repli'd.
o thou for whom and from whom i was formd flesh of thy flesh, and without whom am to no end, my guide and head, what thou hast said is just and right. for wee to him indeed all praises owe, and daily thanks, i chiefly who enjoy so farr the happier lot, enjoying thee praeeminent by so much odds, while thou like consort to thy self canst no where find. that day i oft remember, when from sleep i first awak't, and found my self repos'd under a shade of flours, much wondring where and what i was, whence thither brought, and how. not distant far from thence a murmuring sound of waters issu'd from a cave and spread into a liquid plain, then stood unmov'd pure as th' expanse of heav'n; i thither went with unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe on the green bank, to look into the cleer smooth lake, that to me seemd another skie. as i bent down to look, just opposite, a shape within the watry gleam appeerd bending to look on me, i started back, it started back, but pleas'd i soon returnd, pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks of sympathie and love; there i had fixt mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire, had not a voice thus warnd me,
what thou seest, what there thou seest fair creature is thy self, with thee it came and goes: but follow me, and i will bring thee where no shadow staies thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd mother of human race: what could i doe, but follow strait, invisibly thus led? till i espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall, under a platan, yet methought less faire, less winning soft, less amiablie milde, then that smooth watry image; back i turnd, thou following cryd'st aloud, return faire eve, whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art, his flesh, his bone; to give thee being i lent out of my side to thee, neerest my heart substantial life, to have thee by my side henceforth an individual solace dear; part of my soul i seek thee, and thee claim my other half: with that thy gentle hand seisd mine, i yielded, and from that time see how beauty is excelld by manly grace and wisdom, which alone is truly fair. so spake our general mother, and with eyes of conjugal attraction unreprov'd, and meek surrender, half imbracing leand on our first father, half her swelling breast naked met his under the flowing gold of her loose tresses hid: he in delight both of her beauty and submissive charms smil'd with superior love, as jupiter on juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds that shed may flowers; and press'd her matron lip with kisses pure: aside the devil turnd for envie, yet with jealous leer maligne ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind. sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two imparadis't in one anothers arms the happier eden, shall enjoy thir fill of bliss on bliss, while i to hell am thrust, where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, among our other torments not the least, still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines; yet let me not forget what i have gain'd from thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems: one fatal tree there stands of knowledge call'd, forbidden them to taste: knowledge forbidd'n? suspicious, reasonless.
why should thir lord envie them that? can it be sin to know, can it be death? and do they onely stand by ignorance, is that thir happie state, the proof of thir obedience and thir faith? o fair foundation laid whereon to build thir ruine! hence i will excite thir minds with more desire to know, and to reject envious commands, invented with designe to keep them low whom knowledge might exalt equal with gods; aspiring to be such, they taste and die: what likelier can ensue? but first with narrow search i must walk round this garden, and no corner leave unspi'd; a chance but chance may lead where i may meet some wandring spirit of heav'n, by fountain side, or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw what further would be learnt.
live while ye may, yet happie pair; enjoy, till i return, short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. so saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd, but with sly circumspection, and began through wood, through waste, o're hill, o're dale his roam. mean while in utmost longitude, where heav'n with earth and ocean meets, the setting sun slowly descended, and with right aspect against the eastern gate of paradise leveld his eevning rayes: it was a rock of alablaster, pil'd up to the clouds, conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent accessible from earth, one entrance high; the rest was craggie cliff, that overhung still as it rose, impossible to climbe. betwixt these rockie pillars gabriel sat chief of th' angelic guards, awaiting night; about him exercis'd heroic games th' unarmed youth of heav'n, but nigh at hand celestial armourie, shields, helmes, and speares, hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold. thither came uriel, gliding through the eeven on a sun beam, swift as a shooting starr in autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd impress the air, and shews the mariner from what point of his compass to beware impetuous winds: he thus began in haste. gabriel, to thee thy course by lot hath giv'n charge and strict watch that to this happie place no evil thing approach or enter in; this day at highth of noon came to my spheare a spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know more of th' almighties works, and chiefly man gods latest image: i describ'd his way bent all on speed, and markt his aerie gate; but in the mount that lies from eden north, where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks alien from heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd: mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew i fear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise new troubles; him thy care must be to find. to whom the winged warriour thus returnd: uriel, no wonder if thy perfet sight, amid the suns bright circle where thou sitst, see farr and wide: in at this gate none pass the vigilance here plac't, but such as come well known from heav'n; and since meridian hour no creature thence: if spirit of other sort, so minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds on purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude spiritual substance with corporeal barr. but if within the circuit of these walks, in whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom thou tellst, by morrow dawning i shall know. so promis'd hee, and uriel to his charge returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd bore him slope downward to the sun now fall'n beneath th' azores; whither the prime orb, incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd diurnal, or this less volubil earth by shorter flight to th' east, had left him there arraying with reflected purple and gold the clouds that on his western throne attend: now came still eevning on, and twilight gray had in her sober liverie all things clad; silence accompanied, for beast and bird, they to thir grassie couch, these to thir nests were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale; she all night long her amorous descant sung; silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the firmament with living saphirs: hesperus that led the starrie host, rode brightest, till the moon rising in clouded majestie, at length apparent queen unvaild her peerless light, and o're the dark her silver mantle threw. when adam thus to eve: fair consort, th' hour of night, and all things now retir'd to rest mind us of like repose, since god hath set labour and rest, as day and night to men successive, and the timely dew of sleep now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines our eye-lids; other creatures all day long rove idle unimploid, and less need rest; man hath his daily work of body or mind appointed, which declares his dignitie, and the regard of heav'n on all his waies; while other animals unactive range, and of thir doings god takes no account. to morrow ere fresh morning streak the east with first approach of light, we must be ris'n, and at our pleasant labour, to reform yon flourie arbors, yonder allies green, our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, that mock our scant manuring, and require more hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth: those blossoms also, and those dropping gumms, that lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth, ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; mean while, as nature wills, night bids us rest. to whom thus eve with perfet beauty adornd. my author and disposer, what thou bidst unargu'd i obey; so god ordains, god is thy law, thou mine: to know no more is womans happiest knowledge and her praise. with thee conversing i forget all time, all seasons and thir change, all please alike. sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, with charm of earliest birds; pleasant the sun when first on this delightful land he spreads his orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour, glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth after soft showers; and sweet the coming on of grateful eevning milde, then silent night with this her solemn bird and this fair moon, and these the gemms of heav'n, her starrie train: but neither breath of morn when she ascends with charm of earliest birds, nor rising sun on this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure, glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers, nor grateful eevning mild, nor silent night with this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon, or glittering starr-light without thee is sweet. but wherfore all night long shine these, for whom this glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? to whom our general ancestor repli'd. daughter of god and man, accomplisht eve, those have thir course to finish, round the earth, by morrow eevning, and from land to land in order, though to nations yet unborn, ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise; least total darkness should by night regaine her old possession, and extinguish life in nature and all things, which these soft fires not only enlighten, but with kindly heate of various influence foment and warme, temper or nourish, or in part shed down thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow on earth, made hereby apter to receive perfection from the suns more potent ray. these then, though unbeheld in deep of night, shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none, that heav'n would want spectators, god want praise; millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:. all these with ceasless praise his works behold both day and night: how often from the steep of echoing hill or thicket have we heard celestial voices to the midnight air, sole, or responsive each to others note singing thir great creator: oft in bands while they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk with heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds in full harmonic number joind, thir songs divide the night, and lift our thoughts to heaven. thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd on to thir blissful bower; it was a place chos'n by the sovran planter, when he fram'd all things to mans delightful use; the roofe of thickest covert was inwoven shade laurel and mirtle, and what higher grew of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side acanthus, and each odorous bushie shrub fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour, iris all hues, roses, and gessamin rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought mosaic; underfoot the violet, crocus, and hyacinth with rich inlay broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone of costliest emblem: other creature here beast, bird, insect, or worm durst enter none; such was thir awe of man.
in shadie bower more sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd, pan or silvanus never slept, nor nymph, nor faunus haunted.
here in close recess with flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs espoused eve deckt first her nuptial bed, and heav'nly quires the hymenaean sung, what day the genial angel to our sire brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd, more lovely then pandora, whom the gods endowd with all thir gifts, and o too like in sad event, when to the unwiser son of japhet brought by hermes, she ensnar'd mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd on him who had stole joves authentic fire. thus at thir shadie lodge arriv'd, both stood both turnd, and under op'n skie ador'd the god that made both skie, air, earth and heav'n which they beheld, the moons resplendent globe and starrie pole: thou also mad'st the night, maker omnipotent, and thou the day, which we in our appointed work imployd have finisht happie in our mutual help and mutual love, the crown of all our bliss ordaind by thee, and this delicious place for us too large, where thy abundance wants partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. but thou hast promis'd from us two a race to fill the earth, who shall with us extoll thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, and when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. this said unanimous, and other rites observing none, but adoration pure which god likes best, into thir inmost bowre handed they went; and eas'd the putting off these troublesom disguises which wee wear, strait side by side were laid, nor turnd i weene adam from his fair spouse, nor eve the rites mysterious of connubial love refus'd: whatever hypocrites austerely talk of puritie and place and innocence, defaming as impure what god declares pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all. our maker bids increase, who bids abstain but our destroyer, foe to god and man? haile wedded love, mysterious law, true source of human ofspring, sole proprietie, in paradise of all things common else. by thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure, relations dear, and all the charities of father, son, and brother first were known. farr be it, that i should write thee sin or blame, or think thee unbefitting holiest place, perpetual fountain of domestic sweets, whose bed is undefil'd and chaste pronounc't, present, or past, as saints and patriarchs us'd. here love his golden shafts imploies, here lights his constant lamp, and waves his purple wings, reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile of harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard, casual fruition, nor in court amours mixt dance, or wanton mask, or midnight bal, or serenate, which the starv'd lover sings to his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. these lulld by nightingales imbraceing slept, and on thir naked limbs the flourie roof showrd roses, which the morn repair'd.
sleep on blest pair; and o yet happiest if ye seek no happier state, and know to know no more. now had night measur'd with her shaddowie cone half way up hill this vast sublunar vault, and from thir ivorie port the cherubim forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd to thir night watches in warlike parade, when gabriel to his next in power thus spake. uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south with strictest watch; these other wheel the north, our circuit meets full west. as flame they part half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear. from these, two strong and suttle spirits he calld that neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. ithuriel and zephon, with wingd speed search through this garden, leave unsearcht no nook, but chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge, now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme. this eevning from the sun's decline arriv'd who tells of som infernal spirit seen hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd the barrs of hell, on errand bad no doubt: such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. so saying, on he led his radiant files, daz'ling the moon; these to the bower direct in search of whom they sought: him there they found squat like a toad, close at the eare of eve; assaying by his devilish art to reach the organs of her fancie, and with them forge illusions as he list, phantasms and dreams, or if, inspiring venom, he might taint th' animal spirits that from pure blood arise like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise at least distemperd, discontented thoughts, vaine hopes, vaine aimes, inordinate desires blown up with high conceits ingendring pride. him thus intent ithuriel with his spear touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure touch of celestial temper, but returns of force to its own likeness: up he starts discoverd and surpriz'd.
as when a spark lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid fit for the tun som magazin to store against a rumord warr, the smuttie graine with sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the aire: so started up in his own shape the fiend. back stept those two faire angels half amaz'd so sudden to behold the grieslie king; yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. which of those rebell spirits adjudg'd to hell com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd, why satst thou like an enemie in waite here watching at the head of these that sleep? know ye not then said satan, fill'd with scorn, know ye not mee? ye knew me once no mate for you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; not to know mee argues your selves unknown, the lowest of your throng; or if ye know, why ask ye, and superfluous begin your message, like to end as much in vain? to whom thus zephon, answering scorn with scorn. think not, revolted spirit, thy shape the same, or undiminisht brightness, to be known as when thou stoodst in heav'n upright and pure; that glorie then, when thou no more wast good, departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule. but come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account to him who sent us, whose charge is to keep this place inviolable, and these from harm. so spake the cherube, and his grave rebuke severe in youthful beautie, added grace invincible: abasht the devil stood, and felt how awful goodness is, and saw vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd his loss; but chiefly to find here observd his lustre visibly impar'd; yet seemd undaunted.
if i must contend, said he, best with the best, the sender not the sent, or all at once; more glorie will be wonn, or less be lost.
thy fear, said zephon bold, will save us trial what the least can doe single against thee wicked, and thence weak. the fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage; but like a proud steed reind, went hautie on, chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie he held it vain; awe from above had quelld his heart, not else dismai'd.
now drew they nigh the western point, where those half-rounding guard just met, and closing stood in squadron joind awaiting next command.
to whom thir chief gabriel from the front thus calld aloud. o friends, i hear the tread of nimble feet hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne ithuriel and zephon through the shade, and with them comes a third of regal port, but faded splendor wan; who by his gate and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell, not likely to part hence without contest; stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. he scarce had ended, when those two approachd and brief related whom they brought, where found, how busied, in what form and posture coucht. to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake. why hast thou, satan broke the bounds prescrib'd to thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge of others, who approve not to transgress by thy example, but have power and right to question thy bold entrance on this place; imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss? to whom thus satan, with contemptuous brow. gabriel, thou hadst in heav'n th' esteem of wise, and such i held thee; but this question askt puts me in doubt.
lives ther who loves his pain? who would not, finding way, break loose from hell, though thither doomd? thou wouldst thy self, no doubt, and boldly venture to whatever place farthest from pain, where thou mightest hope to change torment with ease, and soonest recompence dole with delight, which in this place i sought; to thee no reason; who knowst only good, but evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object his will who bound us? let him surer barr his iron gates, if he intends our stay in that dark durance: thus much what was askt. the rest is true, they found me where they say; but that implies not violence or harme. thus he in scorn.the warlike angel mov'd, disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd. o loss of one in heav'n to judge of wise, since satan fell, whom follie overthrew, and now returns him from his prison scap't, gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither unlicenc't from his bounds in hell prescrib'd; so wise he judges it to fly from pain however, and to scape his punishment. so judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to hell, which taught thee yet no better, that no pain can equal anger infinite provok't. but wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee came not all hell broke loose? is pain to them less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they less hardie to endure? courageous chief, the first in flight from pain, had'st thou alledg'd to thy deserted host this cause of flight, thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. to which the fiend thus answerd frowning stern. not that i less endure, or shrink from pain, insulting angel, well thou knowst i stood thy fiercest, when in battel to thy aide thy blasting volied thunder made all speed and seconded thy else not dreaded spear. but still thy words at random, as before, argue thy inexperience what behooves from hard assaies and ill successes past a faithful leader, not to hazard all through wayes of danger by himself untri'd. i therefore, i alone first undertook to wing the desolate abyss, and spie this new created world, whereof in hell fame is not silent, here in hope to find better abode, and my afflicted powers to settle here on earth, or in mid aire; though for possession put to try once more what thou and thy gay legions dare against; whose easier business were to serve thir lord high up in heav'n, with songs to hymne his throne, and practis'd distances to cringe, not fight. to whom the warriour angel, soon repli'd. to say and strait unsay, pretending first wise to flie pain, professing next the spie, argues no leader but a lyar trac't, satan, and couldst thou faithful add? o name, o sacred name of faithfulness profan'd! faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? armie of fiends, fit body to fit head; was this your discipline and faith ingag'd, your military obedience, to dissolve allegeance to th' acknowldg'd power supream? and thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem patron of liberty, who more then thou once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd heav'ns awful monarch? wherefore but in hope to dispossess him, and thy self to reigne? but mark what i arreede thee now, avant; flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre within these hallowd limits thou appeer, back to th' infernal pit i drag thee chaind, and seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne the facil gates of hell too slightly barrd. so threatn'd hee, but satan to no threats gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd. then when i am thy captive talk of chaines, proud limitarie cherube, but ere then farr heavier load thy self expect to feel from my prevailing arme, though heavens king ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers, us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels in progress through the rode of heav'n star-pav'd. while thus he spake, th' angelic squadron bright turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes thir phalanx, and began to hemm him round with ported spears, as thick as when a field of ceres ripe for harvest waving bends her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind swayes them; the careful plowman doubting stands least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves prove chaff. on th' other side satan allarm'd collecting all his might dilated stood, like teneriff or atlas unremov'd: his stature reacht the skie, and on his crest sat horror plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe what seemd both spear and shield: now dreadful deeds might have ensu'd, nor onely paradise in this commotion, but the starrie cope of heav'n perhaps, or all the elements at least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne with violence of this conflict, had not soon th' eternal to prevent such horrid fray hung forth in heav'n his golden scales, yet seen betwixt astrea and the scorpion signe, wherein all things created first he weighd, the pendulous round earth with ballanc't aire in counterpoise, now ponders all events, battels and realms: in these he put two weights the sequel each of parting and of fight; the latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam; which gabriel spying, thus bespake the fiend. satan, i know thy strength, and thou knowst mine, neither our own but giv'n; what follie then to boast what arms can doe, since thine no more then heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now to trample thee as mire: for proof look up, and read thy lot in yon celestial sign where thou art weigh'd, and shown how light, how weak, if thou resist. the fiend lookt up and knew his mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.

now morn her rosie steps in th' eastern climea dvancing, sow'd the earth with orient pearle, when adam wak't, so customd, for his sleep was aerie light from pure digestion bred, and temperat vapors bland, which th' only sound of leaves and fuming rills, aurora's fan, lightly dispers'd, and the shrill matin song of birds on every bough; so much the more his wonder was to find unwak'nd eve with tresses discompos'd, and glowing cheek, as through unquiet rest: he on his side leaning half-rais'd, with looks of cordial love hung over her enamour'd, and beheld beautie, which whether waking or asleep, shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice milde, as when zephyrus on flora breathes, her hand soft touching, whisperd thus.
awake my fairest, my espous'd, my latest found, heav'ns last best gift, my ever new delight, awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring our tended plants, how blows the citron grove, what drops the myrrhe, and what the balmie reed, how nature paints her colours, how the bee sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet. such whispering wak'd her, but with startl'd eye on adam, whom imbracing, thus she spake. o sole in whom my thoughts find all repose, my glorie, my perfection, glad i see thy face, and morn return'd, for i this night, such night till this i never pass'd, have dream'd, if dream'd, not as i oft am wont, of thee, works of day pass't, or morrows next designe, but of offence and trouble, which my mind knew never till this irksom night;
methought close at mine ear one call'd me forth to walk with gentle voice, i though it thine; it said, why sleepst thou eve?
now is the pleasant time, the cool, the silent, save where silence yields to the night-warbling bird, that now awake tunes sweetest his love-labor'd song; now reignes full orb'd the moon, and with more pleasing light shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain, if none regard; heav'n wakes with all his eyes, whom to behold but thee, natures desire, in whose sight all things joy, with ravishment attracted by thy beauty still to gaze. i rose as at thy call, but found thee not; to find thee i directed then my walk; and on, methought, alone i pass'd through ways that brought me on a sudden to the tree of interdicted knowledge: fair it seem'd, much fairer to my fancie then by day: and as i wondring lookt, beside it stood one shap'd and wing'd like one of those from heav'n by us oft seen; his dewie locks distill'd ambrosia; on that tree he also gaz'd; and o fair plant, said he, with fruit surcharg'd, deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet, nor god, nor man; is knowledge so despis'd? or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste? forbid who will, none shall from me withhold longer thy offerd good, why else set here? this said he paus'd not, but with ventrous arme he pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil'd at such bold words voucht with a deed so bold: but he thus overjoy'd, o fruit divine, sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt, forbidd'n here, it seems, as onely fit for god's, yet able to make gods of men: and why not gods of men, since good, the more communicated, more abundant growes, the author not impair'd, but honourd more? here, happie creature, fair angelic eve, partake thou also; happie though thou art, happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be: taste this, and be henceforth among the gods thy self a goddess, not to earth confind, but somtimes in the air, as wee, sometimes ascend to heav'n, by merit thine, and see what life the gods live there, and such live thou. so saying, he drew nigh, and to me held, even to my mouth of that same fruit held part which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell so quick'nd appetite, that i, methought, could not but taste.
forthwith up to the clouds with him i flew, and underneath beheld the earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide and various: wondring at my flight and change to this high exaltation; suddenly my guide was gon, and i, me thought, sunk down, and fell asleep; but o how glad i wak'd to find this but a dream!
thus eve her night related, and thus adam answerd sad. best image of my self and dearer half, the trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep affects me equally; nor can i like this uncouth dream, of evil sprung i fear; yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none, created pure.

the naked earth is warm with spring, and with green grass and bursting trees leans to the sun's gaze glorying, and quivers in the sunny breeze; and life is colour and warmth and light, and a striving evermore for these; and he is dead who will not fight, and who dies fighting has increase. the fighting man shall from the sun take warmth, and life from glowing earth; speed with the light-foot winds to run and with the trees to newer birth; and find, when fighting shall be done, great rest, and fulness after dearth. all the bright company of heaven hold him in their bright comradeship, the dog star, and the sisters seven, orion's belt and sworded hip: the woodland trees that stand together, they stand to him each one a friend; they gently speak in the windy weather; they guide to valley and ridges end. the kestrel hovering by day, and the little owls that call by night, bid him be swift and keen as they, as keen of ear, as swift of sight. the blackbird sings to him: "brother, brother, if this be the last song you shall sing, sing well, for you may not sing another; brother, sing." in dreary doubtful waiting hours, before the brazen frenzy starts, the horses show him nobler powers; —o patient eyes, courageous hearts! and when the burning moment breaks, and all things else are out of mind, and only joy of battle takes him by the throat and makes him blind, through joy and blindness he shall know, not caring much to know, that still nor lead nor steel shall reach him, so that it be not the destined will. the thundering line of battle stands, and in the air death moans and sings; but day shall clasp him with strong hands, and night shall fold him in soft wings.

in flanders fields the poppies blow
between the crosses, row on row,
that mark our place; and in the sky
the larks, still bravely singing, fly scarce heard amid the guns below.
we are the dead. short days ago
we lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
loved and were loved, and now we lie,
in flanders fields. take up our quarrel with the foe: to you from failing hands we throw
the torch; be yours to hold it high.
if ye break faith with us who die
we shall not sleep, though poppies grow

we burrowed night and day with tools of lead, heaped the bank up and cast it in a ring and hurled the earth above. and caesar said, "why, it is excellent. i like the thing." we, who are dead, made it, and wrought, and caesar liked the thing. and here we strove, and here we felt each vein ice-bound, each limb fast-frozen, all night long. and here we held communion with the rain that lashed us into manhood with its thong, cleansing through pain. and the wind visited us and made us strong. up from around us, numbers without name, strong men and naked, vast, on either hand pressing us in, they came. and the wind came and bitter rain, turning grey all the land. that was our game ,to fight with men and storms, and it was grand. for many days we fought them, and our sweat watered the grass, making it spring up green, blooming for us. and, if the wind was wet, our blood wetted the wind, making it keen with the hatred and wrath and courage that our blood had been.so, fighting men and winds and tempests, hot with joy and hate and battle-lust, we fell where we fought. and god said, "killed at last then? what! ye that are too strong for heaven, too clean for hell, (god said) stir not. this be your heaven, or, if ye will, your hell." so again we fight and wrestle, and again hurl the earth up and cast it in a ring. but when the wind comes up, driving the rain (each rain-drop a fiery steed), and the mists rolling up from the plain, this wild procession, this impetuous thing. hold us amazed. we mount the wind-cars, then whip up the steeds and drive through all the world, searching to find somewhere some brethren, sons of the winds and waters of the world. we, who were men, have sought, and found no men in all this world. wind, that has blown here always ceaselessly, bringing, if any man can understand, might to the mighty, freedom to the free; wind, that has caught us, cleansed us, made us grand, wind that is we(we that were men) — make men in all this land, that so may live and wrestle and hate that when they fall at last exultant, as we fell, and come to god, god may say, "do you come then mildly enquiring, is it heaven or hell? why! ye were men! back to your winds and rains. be these your heaven and hell!"

when you see millions of the mouthless dead across your dreams in pale battalions go, say not soft things as other men have said, that you'll remember. for you need not so. give them not praise. for, deaf, how should they know it is not curses heaped on each gashed head? nor tears. their blind eyes see not your tears flow. nor honour. it is easy to be dead. say only this, “they are dead.” then add thereto, “yet many a better one has died before.” then, scanning all the o'ercrowded mass, should you perceive one face that you loved heretofore, it is a spook. none wears the face you knew. great death has made all his for evermore.

the world without imagination
nota: man is the intelligence of his soil,
the sovereign ghost. as such, the socrates
of snails, musician of pears, principium
and lex. sed quaeritur: is this same wig
of things, this nincompated pedagogue,
preceptor to the sea? crispin at sea
created, in his day, a touch of doubt.
an eye most apt in gelatines and jupes,
berries of villages, a barber's eye,
an eye of land, of simple salad-beds,
of honest quilts, the eye of crispin, hung
on porpoises, instead of apricots,
and on silentious porpoises, whose snouts
dibbled in waves that were mustachios,
inscrutable hair in an inscrutable world.
one eats one paté, even of salt, quotha.
it was not so much the lost terrestrial,
the snug hibernal from that sea and salt,
that century of wind in a single puff.
what counted was mythology of self,
blotched out beyond unblotching. crispin,
the lutanist of fleas, the knave, the thane,
the ribboned stick, the bellowing breeches, cloak
of china, cap of spain, imperative haw
of hum, inquisitorial botanist,
and general lexicographer of mute
and maidenly greenhorns, now beheld himself,
a skinny sailor peering in the sea-glass.
what word split up in clickering syllables
and storming under multitudinous tones
was name for this short-shanks in all that brunt?
crispin was washed away by magnitude.
the whole of life that still remained in him
dwindled to one sound strumming in his ear,
ubiquitous concussion, slap and sigh,
polyphony beyond his baton's thrust.
could crispin stem verboseness in the sea,
the old age of a watery realist,
triton, dissolved in shifting diaphanes
of blue and green? a wordy, watery age
that whispered to the sun's compassion, made
a convocation, nightly, of the sea-stars,
and on the cropping foot-ways of the moon
lay grovelling. triton incomplicate with that
which made him triton, nothing left of him,
except in faint, memorial gesturings,
that were like arms and shoulders in the waves,
here, something in the rise and fall of wind
that seemed hallucinating horn, and here,
a sunken voice, both of remembering
and of forgetfulness, in alternate strain.
just so an ancient crispin was dissolved.
the valet in the tempest was annulled.
bordeaux to yucatan, havana next,
and then to carolina. simple jaunt.
crispin, merest minuscule in the gates,
dejected his manner to the turbulence.
the salt hung on his spirit like a frost,
the dead brine melted in him like a dew
of winter, until nothing of himself
remained, except some starker, barer self
in a starker, barer world, in which the sun
was not the sun because it never shone
with bland complaisance on pale parasols,
beetled, in chapels, on the chaste bouquets.
against his pipping sounds a trumpet cried
celestial sneering boisterously. crispin
became an introspective voyager.
here was the veritable ding an sich, at last,
crispin confronting it, a vocable thing,
but with a speech belched out of hoary darks
noway resembling his, a visible thing,
and excepting negligible triton, free
from the unavoidable shadow of himself
that lay elsewhere around him. severance
was clear. the last distortion of romance
forsook the insatiable egotist. the sea
severs not only lands but also selves.
here was no help before reality.
crispin beheld and crispin was made new.
the imagination, here, could not evade,
in poems of plums, the strict austerity
of one vast, subjugating, final tone.
the drenching of stale lives no more fell down.
what was this gaudy, gusty panoply?
out of what swift destruction did it spring?
it was caparison of mind and cloud
and something given to make whole among
the ruses that were shattered by the large.
concerning the thunderstorms of yucatan
in yucatan, the maya sonneteers
of the caribbean amphitheatre,
in spite of hawk and falcon, green toucan
and jay, still to the night-bird made their plea,
as if raspberry tanagers in palms,
high up in orange air, were barbarous.
but crispin was too destitute to find
in any commonplace the sought-for aid.
he was a man made vivid by the sea,
a man come out of luminous traversing,
much trumpeted, made desperately clear,
fresh from discoveries of tidal skies,
to whom oracular rockings gave no rest.
into a savage color he went on.
how greatly had he grown in his demesne,
this auditor of insects! he that saw
the stride of vanishing autumn in a park
by way of decorous melancholy; he
that wrote his couplet yearly to the spring,
as dissertation of profound delight,
stopping, on voyage, in a land of snakes,
found his vicissitudes had much enlarged
his apprehension, made him intricate
in moody rucks, and difficult and strange
in all desires, his destitution's mark.
he was in this as other freemen are,
sonorous nutshells rattling inwardly.
his violence was for aggrandizement
and not for stupor, such as music makes
for sleepers halfway waking. he perceived
that coolness for his heat came suddenly,
and only, in the fables that he scrawled
with his own quill, in its indigenous dew,
of an aesthetic tough, diverse, untamed,
incredible to prudes, the mint of dirt,
green barbarism turning paradigm.
crispin foresaw a curious promenade
or, nobler, sensed an elemental fate,
and elemental potencies and pangs,
and beautiful barenesses as yet unseen,
making the most of savagery of palms,
of moonlight on the thick, cadaverous bloom
that yuccas breed, and of the panther's tread.
the fabulous and its intrinsic verse
came like two spirits parlaying, adorned
in radiance from the atlantic coign,
for crispin and his quill to catechize.
but they came parlaying of such an earth,
so thick with sides and jagged lops of green,
so intertwined with serpent-kin encoiled
among the purple tufts, the scarlet crowns,
scenting the jungle in their refuges,
so streaked with yellow, blue and green and red
in beak and bud and fruity gobbet-skins,
that earth was like a jostling festival
of seeds grown fat, too juicily opulent,
expanding in the gold's maternal warmth.
so much for that. the affectionate emigrant found
a new reality in parrot-squawks.
yet let that trifle pass. now, as this odd
discoverer walked through the harbor streets
inspecting the cabildo, the façade
of the cathedral, making notes, he heard
a rumbling, west of mexico, it seemed,
approaching like a gasconade of drums.
the white cabildo darkened, the façade,
as sullen as the sky, was swallowed up
in swift, successive shadows, dolefully.
the rumbling broadened as it fell. the wind,
tempestuous clarion, with heavy cry,
came bluntly thundering, more terrible
than the revenge of music on bassoons.
gesticulating lightning, mystical,
made pallid flitter. crispin, here, took flight.
an annotator has his scruples, too.
he knelt in the cathedral with the rest,
this connoisseur of elemental fate,
aware of exquisite thought. the storm was one
of many proclamations of the kind,
proclaiming something harsher than he learned
from hearing signboards whimper in cold nights
or seeing the midsummer artifice
of heat upon his pane. this was the span
of force, the quintessential fact, the note
of vulcan, that a valet seeks to own,
the thing that makes him envious in phrase.
and while the torrent on the roof still droned
he felt the andean breath. his mind was free
and more than free, elate, intent, profound
and studious of a self possessing him,
that was not in him in the crusty town
from which he sailed. beyond him, westward, lay
the mountainous ridges, purple balustrades,
in which the thunder, lapsing in its clap,
let down gigantic quavers of its voice,
for crispin to vociferate again.
approaching carolina
the book of moonlight is not written yet
nor half begun, but, when it is, leave room
for crispin, fagot in the lunar fire,
who, in the hubbub of his pilgrimage
through sweating changes, never could forget
that wakefulness or meditating sleep,
in which the sulky strophes willingly
bore up, in time, the somnolent, deep songs.
leave room, therefore, in that unwritten book
for the legendary moonlight that once burned
in crispin's mind above a continent.
america was always north to him,
a northern west or western north, but north,
and thereby polar, polar-purple, chilled
and lank, rising and slumping from a sea
of hardy foam, receding flatly, spread
in endless ledges, glittering, submerged
and cold in a boreal mistiness of the moon.
the spring came there in clinking pannicles
of half-dissolving frost, the summer came,
if ever, whisked and wet, not ripening,
before the winter's vacancy returned.
the myrtle, if the myrtle ever bloomed,
was like a glacial pink upon the air.
the green palmettoes in crepuscular ice
clipped frigidly blue-black meridians,
morose chiaroscuro, gauntly drawn.
how many poems he denied himself
in his observant progress, lesser things
than the relentless contact he desired;
how many sea-masks he ignored; what sounds
he shut out from his tempering ear; what thoughts,
like jades affecting the sequestered bride;
and what descants, he sent to banishment!
perhaps the arctic moonlight really gave
the liaison, the blissful liaison,
between himself and his environment,
which was, and is, chief motive, first delight,
for him, and not for him alone. it seemed
elusive, faint, more mist than moon, perverse,
wrong as a divagation to peking,
to him that postulated as his theme
the vulgar, as his theme and hymn and flight,
a passionately niggling nightingale.
moonlight was an evasion, or, if not,
a minor meeting, facile, delicate.
thus he conceived his voyaging to be
an up and down between two elements,
a fluctuating between sun and moon,
a sally into gold and crimson forms,
as on this voyage, out of goblinry,
and then retirement like a turning back
and sinking down to the indulgences
that in the moonlight have their habitude.
but let these backward lapses, if they would,
grind their seductions on him, crispin knew
it was a flourishing tropic he required
for his refreshment, an abundant zone,
prickly and obdurate, dense, harmonious
yet with a harmony not rarefied
nor fined for the inhibited instruments
of over-civil stops. and thus he tossed
between a carolina of old time,
a little juvenile, an ancient whim,
and the visible, circumspect presentment drawn
from what he saw across his vessel's prow.
he came. the poetic hero without palms
or jugglery, without regalia.
and as he came he saw that it was spring,
a time abhorrent to the nihilist
or searcher for the fecund minimum.
the moonlight fiction disappeared. the spring,
although contending featly in its veils,
irised in dew and early fragrancies,
was gemmy marionette to him that sought
a sinewy nakedness. a river bore
the vessel inward. tilting up his nose,
he inhaled the rancid rosin, burly smells
of dampened lumber, emanations blown
from warehouse doors, the gustiness of ropes,
decays of sacks, and all the arrant stinks
that helped him round his rude aesthetic out.
he savored rankness like a sensualist.
he marked the marshy ground around the dock,
the crawling railroad spur, the rotten fence,
curriculum for the marvellous sophomore.
it purified. it made him see how much
of what he saw he never saw at all.
he gripped more closely the essential prose
as being, in a world so falsified,
the one integrity for him, the one
discovery still possible to make,
to which all poems were incident, unless
that prose should wear a poem's guise at last.
the idea of a colony
nota: his soil is man's intelligence.
that's better. that's worth crossing seas to find.
crispin in one laconic phrase laid bare
his cloudy drift and planned a colony.
exit the mental moonlight, exit lex,
rex and principium, exit the whole
shebang. exeunt omnes. here was prose
more exquisite than any tumbling verse:
a still new continent in which to dwell.
what was the purpose of his pilgrimage,
whatever shape it took in crispin's mind,
if not, when all is said, to drive away
the shadow of his fellows from the skies,
and, from their stale intelligence released,
to make a new intelligence prevail?
hence the reverberations in the words
of his first central hymns, the celebrants
of rankest trivia, tests of the strength
of his aesthetic, his philosophy,
the more invidious, the more desired.
the florist asking aid from cabbages,
the rich man going bare, the paladin
afraid, the blind man as astronomer,
the appointed power unwielded from disdain.
his western voyage ended and began.
the torment of fastidious thought grew slack,
another, still more bellicose, came on.
he, therefore, wrote his prolegomena,
and, being full of the caprice, inscribed
commingled souvenirs and prophecies.
he made a singular collation. thus:
the natives of the rain are rainy men.
although they paint effulgent, azure lakes,
and april hillsides wooded white and pink,
their azure has a cloudy edge, their white
and pink, the water bright that dogwood bears.
and in their music showering sounds intone.
on what strange froth does the gross indian dote,
what eden sapling gum, what honeyed gore,
what pulpy dram distilled of innocence,
that streaking gold should speak in him
or bask within his images and words?
if these rude instances impeach themselves
by force of rudeness, let the principle
be plain. for application crispin strove,
abhorring turk as esquimau, the lute
as the marimba, the magnolia as rose.
upon these premises propounding, he
projected a colony that should extend
to the dusk of a whistling south below the south.
a comprehensive island hemisphere.
the man in georgia waking among pines
should be pine-spokesman. the responsive man,
planting his pristine cores in florida,
should prick thereof, not on the psaltery,
but on the banjo's categorical gut,
tuck tuck, while the flamingos flapped his bays.
sepulchral señors, bibbing pale mescal,
oblivious to the aztec almanacs,
should make the intricate sierra scan.
and dark brazilians in their cafés,
musing immaculate, pampean dits,
should scrawl a vigilant anthology,
to be their latest, lucent paramour.
these are the broadest instances. crispin,
progenitor of such extensive scope,
was not indifferent to smart detail.
the melon should have apposite ritual,
performed in verd apparel, and the peach,
when its black branches came to bud, belle day,
should have an incantation. and again,
when piled on salvers its aroma steeped
the summer, it should have a sacrament
and celebration. shrewd novitiates
should be the clerks of our experience.
these bland excursions into time to come,
related in romance to backward flights,
however prodigal, however proud,
contained in their afflatus the reproach
that first drove crispin to his wandering.
he could not be content with counterfeit,
with masquerade of thought, with hapless words
that must belie the racking masquerade,
with fictive flourishes that preordained
his passion's permit, hang of coat, degree
of buttons, measure of his salt. such trash
might help the blind, not him, serenely sly.
it irked beyond his patience. hence it was,
preferring text to gloss, he humbly served
grotesque apprenticeship to chance event,
a clown, perhaps, but an aspiring clown.
there is a monotonous babbling in our dreams
that makes them our dependent heirs, the heirs
of dreamers buried in our sleep, and not
the oncoming fantasies of better birth.
the apprentice knew these dreamers. if he dreamed
their dreams, he did it in a gingerly way.
all dreams are vexing. let them be expunged.
but let the rabbit run, the cock declaim.
trinket pasticcio, flaunting skyey sheets,
with crispin as the tiptoe cozener?
no, no: veracious page on page, exact.va nice shady home
crispin as hermit, pure and capable,
dwelt in the land. perhaps if discontent
had kept him still the pricking realist,
choosing his element from droll confect
of was and is and shall or ought to be,
beyond bordeaux, beyond havana, far
beyond carked yucatan, he might have come
to colonize his polar planterdom
and jig his chits upon a cloudy knee.
but his emprize to that idea soon sped.
crispin dwelt in the land and dwelling there
slid from his continent by slow recess
to things within his actual eye, alert
to the difficulty of rebellious thought
when the sky is blue. the blue infected will.
it may be that the yarrow in his fields
sealed pensive purple under its concern.
but day by day, now this thing and now that
confined him, while it cosseted, condoned,
little by little, as if the suzerain soil
abashed him by carouse to humble yet
attach. it seemed haphazard denouement.
he first, as realist, admitted that
whoever hunts a matinal continent
may, after all, stop short before a plum
and be content and still be realist.
the words of things entangle and confuse.
the plum survives its poems. it may hang
in the sunshine placidly, colored by ground
obliquities of those who pass beneath,
harlequined and mazily dewed and mauved
in bloom. yet it survives in its own form,
beyond these changes, good, fat, guzzly fruit.
so crispin hasped on the surviving form,
for him, of shall or ought to be in is.
was he to bray this in profoundest brass
arointing his dreams with fugal requiems?
was he to company vastest things defunct
with a blubber of tom-toms harrowing the sky?
scrawl a tragedian's testament? prolong
his active force in an inactive dirge,
which, let the tall musicians call and call,
should merely call him dead? pronounce amen
through choirs infolded to the outmost clouds?
because he built a cabin who once planned
loquacious columns by the ructive sea?
because he turned to salad-beds again?
jovial crispin, in calamitous crape?
should he lay by the personal and make
of his own fate an instance of all fate?
what is one man among so many men?
what are so many men in such a world?
can one man think one thing and think it long?
can one man be one thing and be it long?
the very man despising honest quilts
lies quilted to his poll in his despite.
for realists, what is is what should be.
and so it came, his cabin shuffled up,
his trees were planted, his duenna brought
her prismy blonde and clapped her in his hands,
the curtains flittered and the door was closed.
crispin, magister of a single room,
latched up the night. so deep a sound fell down
it was as if the solitude concealed
and covered him and his congenial sleep.
so deep a sound fell down it grew to be
a long soothsaying silence down and down.
the crickets beat their tambours in the wind,
marching a motionless march, custodians.
in the presto of the morning, crispin trod,
each day, still curious, but in a round
less prickly and much more condign than that
he once thought necessary. like candide,
yeoman and grub, but with a fig in sight,
and cream for the fig and silver for the cream,
a blonde to tip the silver and to taste
the rapey gouts. good star, how that to be
annealed them in their cabin ribaldries!
yet the quotidian saps philosophers
and men like crispin like them in intent,
if not in will, to track the knaves of thought.
but the quotidian composed as his,
of breakfast ribands, fruits laid in their leaves,
the tomtit and the cassia and the rose,
although the rose was not the noble thorn
of crinoline spread, but of a pining sweet,
composed of evenings like cracked shutters flung
upon the rumpling bottomness, and nights
in which those frail custodians watched,
indifferent to the tepid summer cold,
while he poured out upon the lips of her
that lay beside him, the quotidian
like this, saps like the sun, true fortuner.
for all it takes it gives a humped return
exchequering from piebald fiscs unkeyed.viand daughters with curls
portentous enunciation, syllable
to blessed syllable affined, and sound
bubbling felicity in cantilene,
prolific and tormenting tenderness
of music, as it comes to unison,
forgather and bell boldly crispin's last
deduction. thrum, with a proud douceur
his grand pronunciamento and devise.
the chits came for his jigging, bluet-eyed,
hands without touch yet touching poignantly,
leaving no room upon his cloudy knee,
prophetic joint, for its diviner young.
the return to social nature, once begun,
anabasis or slump, ascent or chute,
involved him in midwifery so dense
his cabin counted as phylactery,
then place of vexing palankeens, then haunt
of children nibbling at the sugared void,
infants yet eminently old, then dome
and halidom for the unbraided femes,
green crammers of the green fruits of the world,
bidders and biders for its ecstasies,
true daughters both of crispin and his clay.
all this with many mulctings of the man,
effective colonizer sharply stopped
in the door-yard by his own capacious bloom.
but that this bloom grown riper, showing nibs
of its eventual roundness, puerile tints
of spiced and weathery rouges, should complex
the stopper to indulgent fatalist
was unforeseen. first crispin smiled upon
his goldenest demoiselle, inhabitant,
she seemed, of a country of the capuchins,
so delicately blushed, so humbly eyed,
attentive to a coronal of things
secret and singular. second, upon
a second similar counterpart, a maid
most sisterly to the first, not yet awake
excepting to the motherly footstep, but
marvelling sometimes at the shaken sleep.
then third, a thing still flaxen in the light,
a creeper under jaunty leaves. and fourth,
mere blusteriness that gewgaws jollified,
all din and gobble, blasphemously pink.
a few years more and the vermeil capuchin
gave to the cabin, lordlier than it was,
the dulcet omen fit for such a house.
the second sister dallying was shy
to fetch the one full-pinioned one himself
out of her botches, hot embosomer.
the third one gaping at the orioles
lettered herself demurely as became
a pearly poetess, peaked for rhapsody.
the fourth, pent now, a digit curious.
four daughters in a world too intricate
in the beginning, four blithe instruments
of differing struts, four voices several
in couch, four more personæ, intimate
as buffo, yet divers, four mirrors blue
that should be silver, four accustomed seeds
hinting incredible hues, four self-same lights
that spread chromatics in hilarious dark,
four questioners and four sure answerers.
crispin concocted doctrine from the rout.
the world, a turnip once so readily plucked,
sacked up and carried overseas, daubed out
of its ancient purple, pruned to the fertile main,
and sown again by the stiffest realist,
came reproduced in purple, family font,
the same insoluble lump. the fatalist
stepped in and dropped the chuckling down his craw,
without grace or grumble. score this anecdote
invented for its pith, not doctrinal
in form though in design, as crispin willed,
disguised pronunciamento, summary,
autumn's compendium, strident in itself
but muted, mused, and perfectly revolved
in those portentous accents, syllables,
and sounds of music coming to accord
upon his law, like their inherent sphere,
seraphic proclamations of the pure
delivered with a deluging onwardness.
or if the music sticks, if the anecdote
is false, if crispin is a profitless
philosopher, beginning with green brag,
concluding fadedly, if as a man
prone to distemper he abates in taste,
fickle and fumbling, variable, obscure,
glozing his life with after-shining flicks,
illuminating, from a fancy gorged
by apparition, plain and common things,
sequestering the fluster from the year,
making gulped potions from obstreperous drops,
and so distorting, proving what he proves
is nothing, what can all this matter since
the relation comes, benignly, to its end?
so may the relation of each man be clipped.

as through marble or the lining of certain fish split open and scooped clean, this is the blue vein
that rides, where the flesh is even whiter than the rest of her, the splayed thighs mother forgets, busy struggling for command over bones: her own, those of the chaise longue, all
equally uncooperative, and there’s the wind, too. this is her hair, gone from white to blue in the air.
this is the black, shot with blue, of my dark daddy’s knuckles, that do not change, ever. which is to say they are no more pale in anger than at rest, or when, as
i imagine them now, they follow
the same two fingers he has always used to make the rim of every empty blue
glass in the house sing.
always, the same
blue-to-black sorrow
no black surface can entirely hide.
under the night, somewhere
between the white that is nothing so much as blue, and the black that is, finally; nothing, i am the man neither of you remembers. shielding, in the half-dark,
the blue eyes i sometimes forget
i don’t have. pulling my own stoop-
shouldered kind of blues across paper. apparently misinformed about the rumored stuff of dreams: everywhere i inquired, i was told look for blue.

i’d have you known! it puzzles me forever to hear, day in, day out, the words men use, but never a single word about you, never. strange!—in your every gesture, worlds of news. on busses people talk. on curbs i hear them; in parks i listen, barbershop and bar. in banks they murmur, and i sidle near them; but none allude to you there. none so far.
i read books too, and turn the pages, spying: you must be there, one beautiful as you! but never, not by name. no planes are flying your name in lacy trailers past the blue marquees of heaven. no trumpets cry your fame. strange!—how no constellations spell your name!

and go on out
over the sea marshes and the brant in bays
and over the hills of tall hickory
and over the crater lakes and canyons
and on up through the spheres of diminishing air
past the blackset noctilucent clouds
where one wants to stop and look
way past all the light diffusions and bombardments
up farther than the loss of sight
into the unseasonal undifferentiated empty stark and i know if i find you i will have to stay with the earth
inspecting with thin tools and ground eyes
trusting the microvilli sporangia and simplest
coelenterates
and praying for a nerve cell
with all the soul of my chemical reactions
and going right on down where the eye sees only traces you are everywhere partial and entire
you are on the inside of everything and on the outside i walk down the path down the hill where the sweetgum
has begun to ooze spring sap at the cut
and i see how the bark cracks and winds like no other bark
chasmal to my ant-soul running up and down
and if i find you i must go out deep into your
far resolutions
and if i find you i must stay here with the separate leaves

after the leaves have fallen, we return
to a plain sense of things. it is as if
we had come to an end of the imagination,
inanimate in an inert savoir.
it is difficult even to choose the adjective
for this blank cold, this sadness without cause.
the great structure has become a minor house.
no turban walks across the lessened floors.
the greenhouse never so badly needed paint.
the chimney is fifty years old and slants to one side.
a fantastic effort has failed, a repetition
in a repetitiousness of men and flies.
yet the absence of the imagination had
itself to be imagined. the great pond,
the plain sense of it, without reflections, leaves,
mud, water like dirty glass, expressing silence
of a sort, silence of a rat come out to see,
the great pond and its waste of the lilies, all this
had to be imagined as an inevitable knowledge,
required, as a necessity requires.

why should i blame her that she filled my days with misery, or that she would of late 
have taught to ignorant men most violent ways, 
or hurled the little streets upon the great, 
had they but courage equal to desire? 
what could have made her peaceful with a mind that nobleness made simple as a fire, 
with beauty like a tightened bow, a kind that is not natural in an age like this, 
being high and solitary and most stern? 
why, what could she have done, being what she is? 
was there another troy for her to burn?

oh, love, he went a-straying, a long time ago! i missed him in the maying, when blossoms were of snow; so back i came by the old sweet way; and for i loved him so, wept that he came not with me, a long time ago! wide open stood my chamber door, and one stepped forth to greet; gray grief, strange grief, who turned me sore with words he spake so sweet. i gave him meat; i gave him drink; (and listened for love’s feet.) how many years? i cannot think; in truth, i do not know— ah, long time ago! oh, love, he came not back again, although i kept me fair; and each white may, in field and lane, i waited for him there! yea, he forgot; but grief stayed on, and in love’s empty chair doth sit and tell of days long gone— ’tis more than i can bear!

i stood inside myself
like a dead tree or a tower.
i pulled the rope
of braided hair
and high above me
a bell of leaves tolled.
because my hand
stabbed its brother,
i said: make it stone.
because my tongue
spoke harshly, i said:
make it dust.
and yet
it was not death, but
her body in its green dress
i longed for. that’s why
i stood for days in the field
until the grass turned black
and the rain came.

when i see you, who were so wise and cool, gazing with silly sickness on that fool you’ve given your love to, your adoring hands touch his so intimately that each understands, i know, most hidden things; and when i know your holiest dreams yield to the stupid bow of his red lips, and that the empty grace of those strong legs and arms, that rosy face, has beaten your heart to such a flame of love, that you have given him every touch and move, wrinkle and secret of you, all your life, —oh! then i know i’m waiting, lover-wife, for the great time when love is at a close, and all its fruit’s to watch the thickening nose and sweaty neck and dulling face and eye, that are yours, and you, most surely, till you die! day after day you’ll sit with him and note the greasier tie, the dingy wrinkling coat; as prettiness turns to pomp, and strength to fat, and love, love, love to habit! and after that, when all that’s fine in man is at an end, and you, that loved young life and clean, must tend a foul sick fumbling dribbling body and old, when his rare lips hang flabby and can’t hold slobber, and you’re enduring that worst thing, senility’s queasy furtive love-making, and searching those dear eyes for human meaning, propping the bald and helpless head, and cleaning a scrap that life’s flung by, and love’s forgotten,— then you’ll be tired; and passion dead and rotten; and he’ll be dirty, dirty! o lithe and free and lightfoot, that the poor heart cries to see, that’s how i’ll see your man and you!—but you —oh, when that time comes, you’ll be dirty too!

good-bye!—no, do not grieve that it is over,
the perfect hour;
that the winged joy, sweet honey-loving rover,

glad was the living—blessed be the dying.

the time is important here—not because this has been a long winter or because it is my first at home since childhood—but because there is so much else to be unsure of. we are on the brink of an invasion.at a time like this how is it that when i left only a week ago
there was three feet of snow on the ground,
and now there is none, not even a single patch on in the shadow of the fence-line. and to think i paid a cousin twenty dollars to shovel the walk. he and two of his buddies, still smelling of an all-nighter, arrived at 7 am to begin their work. when i left them a while later and noticed their ungloved hands, winter made me feel selfish and unsure. this ground seems unsure of itself for its own reasons
and we do not gauge enough of our lives by changes in temperature.
when i first began to write poems
i was laying claim to battle.
it started with a death that i tried to say
was unjust, not because of the actual
dying, but because of what was left.
what time of year was that?
i have still not yet learned to write of war.
i have friends who speak out—as is necessary—
with subtle and unsubtle force.
but i am from this place and a great deal
has been going wrong for some time now.
the two young indian boys who almost drowned
last night in the fast-rising creek near school
are casualties in any case.
there have been too many just like them
and i have no way to fix these things.
a friend from boston wrote something to me last week
about not having the intelligence
to take as subject for his poems
anything other than his own life.
for a while now i have sensed this in my own mood:
this poem was never supposed to mention
itself, other writers, or me.
but i will not regret that those boys made it home,
or that the cousins used the money at the bar.
still, there are no lights on this street.
still, there is so much mud outside
that we carry it indoors with us.

think of wind and her wild ways the year we had nothing to lose and lost it anyway in the cursed country of the fox. we still talk about that winter, how the cold froze imaginary buffalo on the stuffed horizon of snowbanks. the haunting voices of the starved and mutilated broke fences, crashed our thermostat dreams, and we couldn’t stand it one more time. so once again we lost a winter in stubborn memory, walked through cheap apartment walls, skated through fields of ghosts into a town that never wanted us, in the epic search for grace.
like coyote, like rabbit, we could not contain our terror and clowned our way through a season of false midnights. we had to swallow that town with laughter, so it would go down easy as honey. and one morning as the sun struggled to break ice, and our dreams had found us with coffee and pancakes in a truck stop along highway 80, we found grace. i could say grace was a woman with time on her hands, or a white buffalo escaped from memory. but in that dingy light it was a promise of balance. we once again understood the talk of animals, and spring was lean and hungry with the hope of children and corn. i would like to say, with grace, we picked ourselves up and walked into the spring thaw. we didn’t; the next season was worse. you went home to leech lake to work with the tribe and i went south. and, wind, i am still crazy. i know there is something larger than the memory of a dispossessed people. we have seen it.

for ten days now, two luna moths remain
silk-winged and lavish as a double broach
pinned beneath the porch light of my cabin.
two of them, patinaed that sea-glass green
of copper weather vanes nosing the wind,
the sun-lit green of rockweed, the lichen's
green scabbing-over of the bouldered shore,
the plush green peat that carpets the island,
that hushes, sinks then holds a boot print
for days, and the sapling-green of new pines
sprouting through it. the miraculous green
origami of their wings - false eyed, doomed
and sensual as the mermaid's long green fins:
a green siren calling from the moonlight.
a green siren calling from the moonlight,
from the sweet gum leaves and paper birches
that shed, like tiny white decrees, scrolled bark.
they emerge from cocoons like greased hinges,
all pheromone and wing, instinct and flutter.
they rise, hardwired, driven, through the creaking
pine branches tufted with beard moss and fog.
two luna moths flitting like exotic birds
towards only each other and light, in these
their final few days, they mate, then starving
they wait, inches apart, on my cabin wall
to die, to share fully each pure and burning
moment. they are, like desire itself, born
without mouths. what, if not this, is love?

calling who skinny? (besides, i knew
they'd beat me up.) i survived
their shoves across the schoolyard
because my five-foot-zero mother drove up

nothing could get me into that car.

in the prodigal smell of biscuits -
eggs and sausage on the grill.

luggage first, the lining of his suit jacket dangling
as always, just when you’d given up hope
nimbly he backs out of the taxi
eyes nervously extending, like brave crabs
everywhere at once, keeping track of his papers
he pilots himself into the home berth
like a small tug in a cloud of seagulls
worries flutter around him so thick
it takes him some time to arrive
and you wonder if he’s ever really been happy:
when the blue eyes blur
and stare out to sea
whether it’s only a daydream
or a long pain that silences him
in such gray distances
you’ll never know, but now
turning to you, the delicate mouth
like a magician
is curious, sensitive, playing tricks,
pouting like a wise turtle
it seems he has a secret
with the driver,
with the stewardess on the airplane
so that even when he opens his arms
when the warm voice surrounds you,
wraps you in rough bliss,
just before you go under
suddenly you remember:
the beloved does not come
from nowhere: out of himself, alone
often he comes slowly, carefully
after a long taxi ride
past many beautiful men and women
and many dead bodies,
mysterious and important companions.

no matter how she tilts her head to hear
she sees the irritation in their eyes.
she knows how they can read a small rejection,
a little judgment, in every what did you say?
so now she doesn’t say what? or come again?
she lets the syllables settle, hoping they form
some sort of shape that she might recognize.
when they don’t, she smiles with everyone else,
and then whoever was talking turns to her
and says, “break wooden coffee, don’t you know?”
she pulls all she can focus into the face
to know if she ought to nod or shake her head.
in that long space her brain talks to itself.
the person may turn away as an act of mercy,
leaving her there in a room full of understanding
with nothing to cover her, neither sound nor silence .

the gowns and dresses hang like fleece in their glaring whiteness, sheepskin-softness,
the ruffled matrimonial love in which the brides- in-waiting dance around, expectantly, hummingbirds to tulips.
i was dragged here: david’s bridal, off the concrete-gray arterial highways of a naval town.
i sink into the flush bachelors’ couch, along with other men sprinkled throughout the shop, as my friend and her female compatriots parade taffeta dresses in monstrous shades of pastels—persimmons, lilacs, periwinkles—the colors of weddings and religious holidays.
trains drag on the floor, sleeves drape like limp, pressed sheets of candied fruits, ribbons fluttering like pale leaves.
i watch families gathered together: the women, like worshippers, circling around the smiling brides-to-be, as if they were the anointed ones.
the men, in turn, submerge deeper into couches, into sleep, while the haloed, veiled women cannot contain their joy, they flash their winning smiles, and they are beautiful.

she would bring down the little birds.
and i would bring down the little birds.
when will she let me bring down the little birds,
pierced from their flight with their necks broken,
their heads like flowers limp from the stem?
i tread my mother's wrist and would draw blood.
behind the little hood my eyes are hooded.
i have gone back into my hooded silence,
talking to myself and dropping off to sleep.
for she has muffled my dreams in the hood she has made me,
sewn round with bells, jangling when i move.
she rides with her little falcon upon her wrist.
she uses a barb that brings me to cower.
she sends me abroad to try my wings
and i come back to her. i would bring down
the little birds to her
i may not tear into, i must bring back perfectly.
i tear at her wrist with my beak to draw blood,
and her eye holds me, anguisht, terrifying.
she draws a limit to my flight.
never beyond my sight, she says.
she trains me to fetch and to limit myself in fetching.
she rewards me with meat for my dinner.
but i must never eat what she sends me to bring her.
yet it would have been beautiful, if she would have carried me,
always, in a little hood with the bells ringing,
at her wrist, and her riding
to the great falcon hunt, and me
flying up to the curb of my heart from her heart
to bring down the skylark from the blue to her feet,
straining, and then released for the flight.
my mother would be a falconress,
and i her gerfalcon raised at her will,
from her wrist sent flying, as if i were her own
pride, as if her pride
knew no limits, as if her mind
sought in me flight beyond the horizon.
ah, but high, high in the air i flew.
and far, far beyond the curb of her will,
were the blue hills where the falcons nest.
and then i saw west to the dying sun--
it seemd my human soul went down in flames.
i tore at her wrist, at the hold she had for me,
until the blood ran hot and i heard her cry out,
far, far beyond the curb of her will
to horizons of stars beyond the ringing hills of the world where the falcons nest
i saw, and i tore at her wrist with my savage beak.
i flew, as if sight flew from the anguish in her eye beyond her sight,
sent from my striking loose, from the cruel strike at her wrist,
striking out from the blood to be free of her.
my mother would be a falconress,
and even now, years after this,
when the wounds i left her had surely heald,
and the woman is dead,
her fierce eyes closed, and if her heart
were broken, it is stilld
i would be a falcon and go free.
i tread her wrist and wear the hood,
talking to myself, and would draw blood.

the empty of stomach
manifests silence
a stillness
that levels
coffee in a cup
and in a respectful manner
allows steam to penetrate
the surface.
reversal of action
has created my sandstone canyon
rooted cedar and sage at my feet.
this movement is where
a tranquility stems.
when my child creates
bubbles through a soapy wand,
i occupy the action of fate
that bursts the perfect form.
a halcyon absorbed
nesting within
the existence of the form
that no longer exists.
the formless form
is where my mind floats.
it is easy to give form
especially with english words
a promotion of mechanical ligaments
binding spirit with assembly-fabricated molds.
just as my hair poses an appendage of my brain
my tongue poses an appendage of my heart.
i cannot classify this thought as a typewritten symbol.
an ideogram of essence
cultivates my stillness to action.

on humming rubber along this white concrete,
lighthearted between the gravities
of source and destination like a man
halfway to the moon
in this bubble of tuneless whistling
at seventy miles an hour from the wind vents,
over prairie swells rising
and falling, over the quick offramp
that drops to its underpass and the truck
thundering beneath as i cross
with the country music twanging out my windows,
i'm grooving down this highway feeling
technology is freedom's other name when
—a meadowlark
comes sailing across my windshield
with breast shining yellow
and five notes pierce
the wind roar like a flash
of nectar on mind,
gone as the country music swells up and drops
me wheeling down
my notch of cement-bottomed sky
between home and away
and wanting
to move again through country that a bird
has defined wholly with song,
and maybe next time see how
he flies so easy, when he sings.

what is a jew in solitude?
what would it mean not to feel lonely or afraid
far from your own or those you have called your own?
what is a woman in solitude:
a queer woman or man?
in the empty street, on the empty beach, in the desert
what in this world as it is can solitude mean? the glassy, concrete octagon suspended from the cliffs
with its electric gate, its perfected privacy
is not what i mean
the pick-up with a gun parked at a turn-out in utah or the golan heights
is not what i mean
the poet’s tower facing the western ocean, acres of forest planted to the east, the woman reading in the cabin, her attack dog suddenly risen
is not what i mean three thousand miles from what i once called home
i open a book searching for some lines i remember
about flowers, something to bind me to this coast as lilacs in the dooryard once
bound me back there—yes, lupines on a burnt mountainside,
something that bloomed and faded and was written down
in the poet’s book, forever:
opening the poet’s book
i find the hatred in the poet’s heart: . . . the hateful-eyed and human-bodied are all about me: you that love multitude may have them robinson jeffers, multitude
is the blur flung by distinct forms against these landward valleys
and the farms that run down to the sea; the lupines
are multitude, and the torched poppies, the grey pacific unrolling its scrolls of surf,
and the separate persons, stooped
over sewing machines in denim dust, bent under the shattering skies of harvest
who sleep by shifts in never-empty beds have their various dreams
hands that pick, pack, steam, stitch, strip, stuff, shell, scrape, scour, belong to a brain like no other
must i argue the love of multitude in the blur or defend
a solitude of barbed-wire and searchlights, the survivalist’s final solution, have i a choice? to wonder far from your own or those you have called your own
to hear strangeness calling you from far away
and walk in that direction, long and far, not calculating risk
to go to meet the stranger without fear or weapon, protection nowhere on your mind
(the jew on the icy, rutted road on christmas eve prays for another jew
the woman in the ungainly twisting shadows of the street:
make those be a woman’s footsteps; as if she could believe in a woman’s god)find someone like yourself.
find others.
agree you will never desert each other.
understand that any rift among you
means power to those who want to do you in.
close to the center, safety; toward the edges, danger.
but i have a nightmare to tell:
i am trying to say
that to be with my people is my dearest wish
but that i also love strangers
that i crave separateness
i hear myself stuttering these words
to my worst friends and my best enemies
who watch for my mistakes in grammar
my mistakes in love.
this is the day of atonement; but do my people forgive me?
if a cloud knew loneliness and fear, i would be that cloud.to love the stranger, to love solitude—am i writing merely about privilege
about drifting from the center, drawn to edges,
a privilege we can’t afford in the world that is,
who are hated as being of our kind: faggot kicked into the icy river, woman dragged from her stalled car
into the mist-struck mountains, used and hacked to death
young scholar shot at the university gates on a summer evening walk, his prizes and studies nothing, nothing availing his blackness
jew deluded that she’s escaped the tribe, the laws of her exclusion, the men too holy to touch her hand;
jew who has turned her back
on midrash and mitzvah (yet wears the chai on a thong between her breasts) hiking alone
found with a swastika carved in her back at the foot of the cliffs (did she die as queer or as jew?)solitude, o taboo, endangered species
on the mist-struck spur of the mountain, i want a gun to defend you
in the desert, on the deserted street, i want what i can’t have:
your elder sister, justice, her great peasant’s hand outspread
her eye, half-hooded, sharp and true and i ask myself, have i thrown courage away?
have i traded off something i don’t name?
to what extreme will i go to meet the extremist?
what will i do to defend my want or anyone’s want to search for her spirit-vision
far from the protection of those she has called her own?
will i find o solitude
your plumes, your breasts, your hair
against my face, as in childhood, your voice like the mockingbird’s
singing yes, you are loved, why else this song?
in the old places, anywhere? what is a jew in solitude?
what is a woman in solitude, a queer woman or man?
when the winter flood-tides wrench the tower from the rock, crumble the prophet’s headland, and the farms slide into the sea
when leviathan is endangered and jonah becomes revenger
when center and edges are crushed together, the extremities crushed together on which the world was founded
when our souls crash together, arab and jew, howling our loneliness within the tribes
when the refugee child and the exile’s child re-open the blasted and forbidden city
when we who refuse to be women and men as women and men are chartered, tell our stories of solitude spent in multitude
in that world as it may be, newborn and haunted, what will solitude mean?1984-1985

for those who ran in the streets,
there were no faces to welcome them back.
josé escaped and loved the war. for those who swam with bitterness
of a scorched love,
there was a rusted car to work on. for those who merely passed
and reclined in prayer,
there was the tower and the cross. for those who dedicated tongues
to the living and dying,
there were turquoise painted doorways. for those who left their children
tied to the water heater,
there was a shout and a name. for those whose world
was real and beautiful,
there was a cigarette and a saint. for those who asked josé
to stay and feed his children,
there were flowers at their funerals. for those who carried a shovel
tattooed on their backs,
there was a wet towel and a bottle. for those who swept the street
of superstition and lie,
there was the house to come home to. for those who came home late
and put their swollen feet up,
there was love and the smell of dirty socks. for those who feared the devil
and spit on his painted arms,
there was a lesson in rosaries. for those who had to leave
before the sun went down,
there was asphalt and a bus. for those who stared at wet plaster
and claimed the face of christ appeared,
there was confinement and stale bread. for those who talked with each other
and said it was time to go,
there was lead in the paint and on the tongue. for those who left children behind,
there was a strange world
of sulphur and sparrow nests. for those who accused their ancestors
of eating salt, there were these hands
tracing what was left after the sweat.

kick in the heart.
kick the starting lance.
throw the ground a word and stand back.
the color of terror is the envy
on body rags, the dragonfly war
scraped off a painting inside the door. kick the shame.
kick the falling dawn as fortunate.
throw the corrupted guest out the door.
a sequence of rhythms bound for
the light on your bed.
on the eggplant cooked for the husband
working late: an ant, a hair—
the only thing said to race the mind.
take someone else’s voice and touch their ears.
make sure they hear you cry
in their own whispers, their harangue. kick the soil.
kick the sweet drowning as if you know
the round jubilance of pear is afraid
of a darkening spoon, a honey of flavor,
the tender one who never touches your plate.
the tired one who rations food
to thank god eternity is here and there. slip the eye the blue-black stranger,
his instrument of scars and neglect,
its tune of every wish besides
the grave of a careless, quiet man.
shape his sound into the thumb asking
for a ride in the years of not going anywhere. kick the alphabet.
kick the hungry thigh and try again.
reduce yourself to a moving mouth, a solemn happiness
that smells of the past, takes hold of the throat
and teaches you to despise omens—
ignore apache mirrors on rock arches
as if you knew what their scratchings meant. kick the heart.
kick the starting lance.
it moves deeper into the month of blinking neon
where vertigo is perfume, desire foaming
on your bare feet killed by frost,
taken by the animal waking inside your holy cross—
a figure of green gowns and things
that follows you until you dance. kick the truth.
kick the belly until it confesses.
admit you were fed by a woman
flapping in the wind, told to sit there by a father
who made her give birth to a shimmering head,
your brain of flowers blossoming upon
the body always first to confess. what snow is left is tired water unmoved by your
seasonal words, your circle healing by slowing down,
swelling to the size of god,
yellow leaves in the blood nothing dangerous—
this impulse, this kick to the brittle lake
where the snow goes away.

i called the white donkey that hurt my left shoulder
the last time it appeared, ramming me
with its ivory head, cracking my back
to relieve me of worry and hope.
i called the white donkey,
surprised at the sound of my voice.
scared, i wondered if the white head
would give me its donkey brain,
snowy matter dripping into my ears
like the horse of the first man who fell off,
the donkey teaching me about desire
and the moan, that white hair on the back
of my head that warns me. i called the donkey.
it came slowly toward me,
huge ears shaking with fury,
its breath turning the air white
as it bit into the white apple
of my throat.
i faced the donkey, watched
its gait become a shuffle of possession,
shaking its head as it stopped to
root its dirty hoofs in the ground. i stepped back and clicked my fingers,
but it would not come closer, its snort
commanding i listen as it farted.
i walked away and did not know it was
i who yearned for labor of the ass
because the animal i summoned
couldn’t remove the white scar from
my heart, a blind life i lived for good.

the kinship with those humans
who speak directly to me
is webbed to the ceiling.
an economy of satellites, a cosmos,
where revision we think
comes without the benefit
of our witness. a peculiar time
when stars with modest faces
sleep in enormity and mirror
death like a child’s infirmity that
despite socio-economics
is still an illness,
definitive as fading paint
grossing a distant

pooled from its center
resonant of some terrific

of its own words

through the teeth of the palisade
lipped under the vineyard of temperate skies. and i can’t tell you that i came
onto a ledge within the shelter of a granite roof,
ceaselessly carved by centuries of dripping water. feeding from pooled water and singular sunlight
a chamisa plant sat like a chopped wood. the opposite end of root
speaking for its entirety through
silence and color. and i wish i could tell you that at the moment
i met its splitting scent under the enormity of stone
your name appeared in my throat with clarity. and i wish we were old
and in front of a grand painting,
a picture or postcard of
picasso’s “guernica” perhaps.
it would be then that i would tell you
picasso once said that it took him his entire life
to learn how to paint like a child. it would be through these words
that would make you understand

on that ledge those years before
when as a young man i extended
like direction, like timbre itself

pours through the kitchen window
like gold leche. after grinding
the nixtamal, a word so beautifully ethnic
it must not only be italicized but underlined
to let you, the reader, know you’ve encountered
something beautifully ethnic, she kneads
with the hands of centuries-old ancestor
spirits who magically yet realistically posses her
until the masa is smooth as a lowrider’s

with care because it says so on a website
that explains how to make homemade corn tortillas.
so much labor for this peasant bread,
this edible art birthed from abuelitas’s
brown skin, which is still glistening

apology before she died i called my abuelita grandma. i cannot remember
if she made corn tortillas from scratch
but, o, how she’d flip the factory fresh
el milagros (quality since 1950)
on the burner, bathe them in butter
& salt for her grandchildren.

that lucia broke the machine twice in one week was evidence enough. he also offered this—she’s no longer automatic, her stitches are crooked and once another seamstress found lucia’s “lost” sewing patterns in the trash. the security guard half listened as lucia gathered her things. then the manager turned directly to her—what is it with you? we give you work, put money in your pocket. she put on her best disappointed face as they escorted her past rows of itchy throats, bowed heads, the refrain of needle through fabric.
every day elena counts pig. a pageant of molded plastic rolling down the conveyor belt. the task: grab miss piggy, pull gown over snout, fasten two tiny buttons, grab another. with each doll elena’s hands grow stiffer. her feet grow heavy as the concrete below. dolls spit at her, or maybe this is imagined, but the ache in her legs might be real. the supervisor brushes against her back when he patrols the floor. after standing for hours, the room begins to blur. her mouth opens like an empty wallet as naked dolls march on. what will settle in, what will rise from the lungs of girls who still burn weeks after detox treatment at a local clinic. speak of headaches, blurred vision, diarrhea. how they suck air thick with sulfuric acid. acetone working past unfiltered exhaust systems and through their livers. most return to work despite doctors’ orders. back inside, the tin roof and their steady perspiration remind them they’re still alive—together one breathing, burning machine. like celia’s pockets, there’s nothing but lint here. lint & dead machines. the sound of layoffs & profit margins. yesterday this department droned an unsynchronized rhythm of coughing girls tethered to well-lubed motors. row after row of pre-asthmatic lungs. black hair buried under perpetual white. the decision was made across the border, he tells them. nothing i can do about it. sometimes celia would imagine the whole place caught inside a tiny globe. something she could pick up. shake. a perpetual conveyor, he patrols her mouth. the sound of unfiltered white. breathing margins. the task: grab elena’s hands. pull. fasten. he also offered crooked patterns. put money in her hair. that lucia broke. was evidence enough? molded vision as a refrain. an empty wallet will rise. speak. how they exhaust systems. despite the blurred other, the ache might be real. something she could pick up. across the border, nothing i can imagine.

Bangkok caught in a slip of particulars,
say, between the dirt road
and the brand-new seven-eleven, a bucket
of lotus, three shades of red
in the mudbank giving way to workers, faces hidden
behind kerchiefs, binding
the copper tines of another half-constructed building,
this fretwork, that rooftop’s progress up and up, the eye riding
a motor’s rev, coming to
a woman who leans over the seventh story’s edge
for the pulley rope’s
basket of rice or rubber mallets,
then a sweep down into
cattle now, their beige skin
over bones, the look of loose tents, or taking in a bronze
buddha, hands folded over the first national melting company,
the red gate, black gate, red, retina arriving at a man throwing straw
clumps to earth so the seeds
don’t wash away, and the light behind him washing
away, and this desire, a gaze
shot along the border which is shaped like a question mark,
cramped with hotels, pink neon grammars blinking
alpha, alpha, alpha isthe bank for you and your needs, another quick catch, the glance stippled
with disappearances, a girl who lifts her skirt
to bathe near the bus stop, a fire
burning/burnt/burning
in the field of bulldozers, an eye trying to fix itself
as the vehicle turns, the mind from
nascent to nation, 
drifting in instances, a grit
in wind worrying
the surface, the facts, out to finger the invisible
gap we would inhabit, pulsing always
in between.

this one’s on route 80 south of water’s end, arizona, speeding
anywhere else when i’m tired
of reading the yellow dash-and-dash, highway’s old adage.
sunglasses coaxed
yellows to reds, though there are none where i look
into the camera.
behind me, a blur of roadside cactus called
“succulents,”
for the moisture they save for years.
the sky cut from indigo to blue to white until
i wished for the sunset’s truncations to stay there,
thinking, too, that the verge of its curve
could flirt me into
the absolute.
moving on, in bangkok, i’m always crouching in these,
wanting to keep my head
lower than his
to show i know
he’s mother’s father. asked, on going in, not to say anything
if he brought up the distant
old dealings, metallic shrillings
of long-dead women,
asked to ignore what they’d do for him,
offerings he could almost eat a meal on. and this from the aunt who was asked to leave
the family when she was young,
“for the sake of the children,”
drawing the bad lot.
no one told me why. that’s my foot in the foreground.
that was the daylight’s assignment
of unwavering white, the background. these are only the circumstances. as for an end to the glare
getting the last word in,
there was none.
he’d set the machine on the tripod himself,
return to read the newspaper, wait for the click,
and want to keep it,
the stop-time, that is,
the pretending to read the newspaper.
held half in the shadow fans of the palm tree,
half in a browbeat of sun.
so that the machine had to catch him quickly, the clarity,
the shot of his legs as suddenly: brown leather sheaves holding bone.
say the moment arrives
at the frame, and she who is about to enter
the picture approaches.
at the end of the road trip, she turns back
in the hopes of memorizing what’s been passed,
the colors that changed, the mirror-winks,
the real moisture, invisible, along side mirage. his face was a once-darker shade of dust in his country.

i can tell you, sweeping the several jigsaw lizards
away from your casket, away from their expert
invasions, kneeling by the order of our births
alongside the mother-of-pearl mosaics,
the family at your death keeps to form,
having to act out that love of endings. i can say the little i know of how you lived
is your patient gaze in old photographs,
surrounded by three generations, most of the spindling
offspring back from the states or australia or wherever
they’d been taken, children barely known but abided
on holidays. today i’m told we have to place
pennies in the dead man’s mouth
to remind us of the portions
left behind.
you pay the debt,
someone says, you give your something solid back, push your currency up against the open, up against the father tongue. it’s the formal
silence we love, the hush that’s planned,
the good answer,
monks, boyish and newly shorn, who know
to whip your burial cloth exactly three times
over the altar flame to purify countless threads. who know when to kneel, when to back away
from the casket. the casket itself carved
patiently, inlaid with the images,
portions left behind of silver
shrunken disciples, each framed to each then
framed again by squares of alabaster scrollwork
whittled into black wood:
the whole teak surface worried,
grandfather, with carpenter’s gold,
splintered,
then resplintered, puzzled with lapis. the eastern window’s been slivered open,
to make the sun stab
the craftmen’s metallic fretwork.
the mourners too,
suddenly embossed, become dozens shifting
to kneel. when a few clouds eclipse the sun, wiping away the borders,
the frame and scrimshaw,
so that we stand
briefly
in the room’s darkened largeness,
next to me someone whispers, how your vessel is rented,
a work
to be given back.

what a giant i must seem to them, an exhausted giant who dozes above her sewing.
asleep in mid-stitch, sorting the day’s haul of cinders, rubies, griefs—
they were laughing and carrying on, their tiny silver needles flying in and out, tiny silver thimbles on their fingers.
it’s no use of course, keeping secrets from them, when chattering is almost their religion.
some held corners of the flag like an enormous quilt, and some danced on little shelves above the workshop.
they were so merrie that i fell asleep again.
in the morning my beautiful flag was finished, every stitch in place and every seam.
so now i raise it—slowly, underneath a secret sky.
near the door to the half-daft and the cradle of kleptocracy.
where it rips and shivers, rips and shivers once more
and makes me furiously glad, and fills me up with serious pleasure.

to this place, they feared the cobwebs

mown grass has the peppery smell
of being crowded together on
this bed, and a feeling of dark apprehension
came over him. i watch a horse

through you.
you’ll die, novalis says, you’ll die
following endless rows
of sheep into your

intimate equations more complicated
than the coordinates of past

what do we do with the body, do we
burn it, do we set it in dirt or in
stone, do we wrap it in balm, honey,
oil, and then gauze and tip it onto
and trust it to a raft and to water?
what will happen to the memory of his
body, if one of us doesn't hurry now
and write it down fast? will it be
salt or late light that it melts like?
floss, rubber gloves, and a chewed cap
to a pen elsewhere —how are we to
regard his effects, do we throw them
or use them away, do we say they are
relics and so treat them like relics?
does his soiled linen count? if so,
would we be wrong then, to wash it?
there are no instructions whether it
should go to where are those with no
linen, or whether by night we should
memorially wear it ourselves, by day
reflect upon it folded, shelved, empty.
here, on the floor behind his bed is
a bent photo—why? were the two of
them lovers? does it mean, where we
found it, that he forgot it or lost it
or intended a safekeeping? should we
attempt to make contact? what if this
other man too is dead? or alive, but
doesn't want to remember, is human?
is it okay to be human, and fall away
from oblation and memory, if we forget,
and can't sometimes help it and sometimes
it is all that we want? how long, in
dawns or new cocks, does that take?
what if it is rest and nothing else that
we want? is it a findable thing, small?
in what hole is it hidden? is it, maybe,
a country? will a guide be required who
will say to us how? do we fly? do we
swim? what will i do now, with my hands?

and laid them aside, folded in thirds,
and given me her purse and her packages to hold
so she can accomplish this august ritual

watches the sky.

where is it from here?
what is its name?—
this rain on a morning ride to school,
winter, my seventh year,
my father driving
through rain, his eyes fixed on a world
of credit and debt. on the
radio, devotion to
the lifter of harm from those who despair,
knower of secrets with the knowledge of certainty.
not even the anguish of those
years, the heavy
traffic, cold and wind could have
touched me. i was certain the palm
holding me would be
struck again. chance allows
for that and for stars to throb
in reachable depths.
filled with grief bordering happiness,
i didn’t care if i was safe,
whether the storm
was over, only that it came, the slash
of lightning, the groaning sky,
and the storms we made,
how rain stripped everything of urgency,
how to the lifter of harm rise
those who despair.

long after the sun falls into the sea
and twilight slips off the horizon like a velvet sheet
and the air gets soaked in blackness;
long after clouds hover above like boulders
and stars crawl up and stud the sky;
long after bodies tangle, dance, and falter
and fatigue blows in and bends them
and sleep unloads its dreams and kneads them
and sleepers dive into the rivers inside them,
a girl unlatches a window,
walks shoeless into a forest,
her dark hair a flag rippling in darkness.
she walks into woods, her feet light-stepping
through puddles, over hard packed dirt,
through grassy hills, over sticks and pebbles
over sand soaked in day, stones sun-sizzled
over lakes and frigid streams
through dim cobbled streets
darkened squares and dusty pastures.
she runs from nothing, runs to nothing,
beyond pain, beyond graveyards and clearings.
in the dark the eyes of startled creatures
gleam like a herd of candles.
they scatter and give night its meaning.
what echo of a bell lulled her
what spirit, what scent of a word
whose storm wrote her
what banks fell to drown her
which blood star
which thread of water
which trickle of light
whose heart being launched
whose floating soul seduced her
what promise did it make her
whose memory burned her
whose prayer did she run to answer
whose help, what sorrow clot
what pain dammed inside her
what wall must she rebuild now
whose treasure beckons her
who spread ivy like a veil to blind her?
daybreak lies chained to a blue wall
from which the stars drop
and lose all meaning.
she runs past villages that lost their names
roads that lost their destinations
seas that lost their compasses and sailors
rivers that lost their marshlands and travelers
houses that lost their sleepers and criers
trees that lost their songs and shadows
gardens that lost their violets and benches
valleys that lost their worms and farmers
mountains that lost their prophets and marauders
temples that lost their sinners and spires
lightning that lost its silver and wires
chimeras that lost their bridges
minotaurs that lost their fountains.
crescent moons hover above her,
ancient white feathers, birdless, wingless
lost to their own meaning.
music rises out of her vision.
it stands, a wall covered with silver mosses.
a clarinet sounds a wounded mare,
violins women who lost their children.
flutes blow their hot dry breezes.
drums chuckle the earth’s ceaseless laughter.
pianos are mumbling sorcerers
calling spirits and powers.
cellos chew on the sounds of thunder.
dulcimers skip about on crutches.
dance floors flash their knives
daring their dancers.
words mill about the streets like orphans.
then a lute begins groaning
and dawn loses its meaning.
night girl, night girl
your book is full now.
you have drawn all the pictures.
you have seen many weepers.
stars held your sky in place and moons
floated on your lakes and washed them.
when a bird sings
when dewed branches tilt sunlight into eyes
when curtains are soaked with light
when mirrors drown in shadows,
take your day to the shore, my child.
put out the words that fired your waking,
scatter them on the sand like seeds,
then with your feet gently tap them,
and let the bright waves
receive your meaning.

look here, marcus aurelius, we’ve come to see
your temple, deluded the guards, crawled through a hole
in the fence. why your descendent, my guide and friend
has opted for secrecy, i don’t know. but i do know
what to call the africans, passport-less, yellow-eyed
who will ride the boat before me for naples, they hope.
here the sea curls its granite lip at them and flings a winter
storm like a cough, or the seadog drops them at hannibal’s
shores, where they’ll stand stupefied like his elephants.
what dimension of time will they cross at the hours loop
tight plastic ropes round their ankles and wrists?
what siren song will the trucks shipping them back
to ouagadougou drone into their ears? i look at them
loitering, waiting for the second act of their darkness
to fall. i look at the sky shake her dicey fists.
one can be thankful, i suppose, for not being one of them,
and wrap the fabric of that thought around oneself
to keep the cold wind at bay. but what world is this
that makes our lives sufficient even as the horizon’s rope
is about to snap, while the sea and sky ache to become
an open-ended road? that’s what we’re all waiting for,
a moment to peel itself like skin off fruit, and let us in
on its sweetness as we wait, smoking, or fondling provisions,
listening the engine’s invocational purr. in an hour
that will dawn and dusk at once, one that will stretch
into days strung like beads on the horizon’s throat,
they will ride their tormented ship as the dog star
begins to float on the water, so bright and still,
you’d want to scoop it out in the palm of your hand.
a pair of roman fists robbed of spear and shield;
the tiles of the tapestries mixed in with popcorn
that slipped from the buttery hands, aluminum
wrappers smudged with processed cheese;
countless cigarette butts surround the fallen
columns and beams with a fringe of tarnished foam;
pairs of panties still hot with forbidden passion…
the ruins are not ruined.
without all this garbage
packed, stratified, how else to name our age?
earlier, i had walked the market of sabratha, changed
to its people, but like my old city brought me back to me.
the petty merchants, all selling the same goods, shouted out
jokes to each other. a sudanese waiter carried a tray
with a giant pot of green tea with mint. among the older men,
their heads capped with crimson shennas, i kept seeking
my father’s face. an old lust wafted past me when the abaya-clad
women, scented with knock-off chanel, sashayed by.
the sawdust floors of the shawarma and falafel eateries,
the sandwich maker dabbing insides of loaves
with spoons of searing harissa, my mouth watering
to a childhood burn. pyramids of local oranges,
late season pomegranates, radish and turnip bulbs
stacked like billiard balls, and the half carcasses of lambs
as if made of wax and about to melt off their hooks,
the trays of hearts, kidneys, brains and testicles arrayed
in slick arabesques. the hand-woven rugs where
the extinct mouflon thrives, mincers, hairdryers, and toasters,
their cords tentacles drooping from rusty shelves.
it was as if my eyes were painting, not seeing, what i saw,
my memory slowly building the scene until it assembled whole.
what face did my face put on in the midst of transfiguration?
i know what the eyes of the men my age said, settled now
in comfortable middle age, about the life i left behind.
true, i did envy them the asceticism of their grace,
where a given horizon becomes a birthright—to drive or walk
past the same hills all your life, to eat from the same tree
and drink from the well that gave you your name.
though for centuries the locals broke the statues’
limbs and ground them to make primitive pottery,
enough remains to echo all that has disappeared:
you and the woman leave the towpath, and you brace her
against the trunk of an oak. it’s not the moonlight, but refractions
from suburban homes trapped under cloud-cover
that make her bronze skin glow among glistening trees.
first, god made love:the canopy like the inside of an emerald,
her lips a rush of cochineal. then a route of evanescence
brought her from carthage into these living arms, here.
“a nice time, “ he tells us, how he and four
cousins crossed the desert heading home
on top of three-years’ worth of meager pay
(the tarp ballooning, a giant dough) roped to a truck.
wearing the goggles of the welder he'd hoped
to become, he looked at the sky and wondered “what
those flying, smoke on their tails, thought of us.”
later, deported in a cargo plane, he handed
the tuareg soldiers one of his fake passports,
and they like “space aliens” (in shabby uniforms,
sunglasses, tribal veils) poured into his face.
as the propellers’ hammering calmed to
a shuddering hum, he saw the stars, “hundreds
of them like gnats” swarm mt. akakous’ peak.
“my next road is the water,” he says serving
us tonight, and we promise, if the coffee is good,
to put him on the next boat to the moon
shining over syracuse.
suddenly, i find your descendant’s hands leafing through
my chapters, scribbling a note in the margin of my thoughts:
“how is it,” he asks, “that starlight announces the hour:
how can a song divide desire in two?”
“my flame,” i must have written or said, “coated her body
like silk, one kiss spreading threads of lightening
into her pores, until she became a sob, barely lifted by the wind,
and i became mist, the shadow of a statue at the break of dawn.”
to that he responds, “a platonic echo;” and
“what will come of such a plasticine love?”
marcus aurelius, your descendent knows i’ll leave
as i arrive, so empty he gets lost in me.
two centuries ago, one of my ancestors sat
on one of the communal latrines in mid-morning
and listened to apuleius’s defense. across from him
on that marble hexagon, sat two other men.
on normal days they’d have talked about the olive harvest,
the feast of venus coming soon. but today they listen to
the madaurian’s high eloquence studded with jokes,
cracking their own one-liners, shaking their heads in delight.
away from the hot midday sun and the throngs,
you could say, they had the best seats in the house,
and so they lingered and heard as much as they could
then went about their business. so what if a man maries
an older woman for her money, what impoverished young roman
in his right mind wouldn’t do that? and sure too, if some man
comes to take your inheritance, even if he’s your best friend,
even if he takes good care of your mother, you’d be a fool
not to sue him to the council, even if you’d have to accuse him
falsely of black magic. that’s the beauty of it, or rather,
whoever is going to win will have to make us trust beauty,
that things being already right, can be more right, which
is what “beautiful” really means. and what better way,
to take in all this refinement than hearing it in a latrine
where only beauty shields you from the awful stuff of life.
marcus aurelius, the men at the shore follow your path
into eternity, though they already see their journey
as a quarrel with circumstance, their lives abscesses feeding
on the universe’s hide, tumors in detention camps,
in basement kitchens. their pockets filled with drachmas,
they’ll lift diffident heads and drag feet lead-heavy with shame.
one of them is now driving a taxi in thessaloniki or perugia.
with enough of the language to understand direction, he engages
his late night passengers. in the light of the dashboard
they’ll entrust him with their secrets. with time, he’ll become
a light unto himself, his car a winged chariot of human folly,
and his responses to them saplings nourished in the dark
soil of philosophy. it’s the gift of seasons that stray
from the earth, when soul reigns incidental to flesh,
forgiving to no end, a light that has long surpassed itself.
the birds that drew the line to the first distance
remain nameless to me—
creamy white breasts, gold dust around their eyes,
black/brown (dark roast) wings.
the deserts they crossed, the plains east
or north of here fall like sand from my hands.um bsisi, i want to call them, citizens of a protracted destiny,
native and stranger, prodigal and peasant—
admit now, they you’re none of these,
that you’re not any,
or even all of them combined.
southwest of here is apuleius’s hometown, his inescapable
destination having spent his inheritance on travel and studies.
“lacking the poverty of the rich,” he’s splurged,
a month-long trip to the olympic games; and openhanded,
he gifted his mentors their daughters’ doweries.
few return to madaura once gone, and when heading back
shamefaced like him, they’d do as he did, taking
the longest route hoping the journey would never end. here
in sabratha, the widow hooked him, or he let her reel him,
and that’s how that sordid business happily ended as it began.
i look out toward madaura, my back to the theater
and the latrines, madaura birthplace of augustine, site of
his first schooling—little augustine holding a satchel of scrolls
and a loaf of bread for the teacher, awakened by his mother,
his tiny feet cold in tiny sandals, his stomach warm
with a barley porridge my grandmother used to make, forced
to slurp it, sweetened with honey from the atlas, a sprinkling
of cinnamon and crushed almonds from the family farm.
if the world is that sweet and warm, if it is that mothering,
why then this perpetual scene of separation, this turning
out into the cold toward something he knew he’d love?
he lets go of the neighbors’ boy’s hand warming his own.
he refuses the warm porridge forever, renounces
his mother’s embrace. it only lasted a month,
this partial answer, because even then everyone knew
that the sweet fruit they grew housed the bitterest seeds,
that piety is its own reward while belief only darkens
and deepens like the sea before them, a place
meant for those seeking life other than on this dry earth.
that’s why prophets were welcomed here, calmly,
because god was like rain and they like the saplings
which know only the first verse to the sky’s rainless hymn.
and that’s why africa’s tallest minaret looms unfinished,
visible from the next town over, and for fifty leagues from the sea if
it were turned into a lighthouse for the ships that no longer come.
the merchant who’d built it, money made from smuggling
subsidized goods to carthage and used renaults from rotterdam,
ran out of money, could not afford the mosque that was to stand
next to it, leaving its gray concrete bleaching in the sun.
there’s enough history here to enable anyone to finish the thought.
it’s useless then to track the fate of these travelers,
some, without life jackets, had never learned how to swim.
why not let them live in text as they do in life?—they’ve lived
without words for so long—why not release them
from the pen’s anchor and let them drift to their completion?
in a few weeks you’ll see pedants here with binoculars
trying to catch a glimpse of the ramadan crescent,
and if these migrants stick around here
time will belong to the departure of other travelers,
flocks of um bsisi follwing the sun’s arch,
japanese and korean trawlers sailing to gibraltar
or suez chasing the last herring or sardine.
where is she now in her time?—
her life dissolved in other people’s minutes,
a sense of solitude her diligent companion
even when she lets go of herself to kindness.
he’ll be there when she returns from the party,
he’ll lie beside her when she sleeps. he’ll say,
“time belongs to the species, but your life belongs to me.”
she’ll laugh at his words, and remember what you,
marcus aurelius, had said about losing only the moment
at hand, how it circles in a ring of dead nerves,
how we stand impoverished before what is to come.
she’ll have her answer to your elocution;
she’d always had an answer for you,
one she refuses to share even with herself.
at last they set to sail. they slaughter a rooster,
douse blood on the dido figurehead adorning the prow.
the seadog opens a canvas bag and pulls out a hookah.
his egyptian assistant fills the smoke chamber with seawater,
twists the brass head into it, caking the slit with sand.
he fills the clay bowl with apple-flavored tobacco,
wraps it with foil, pokes it tenderly with a knife.
he picks embers from the going fire, places a few
on the aluminum crown, and inhales and blows
until the bottom vessel fills with a pearly fog,
the color of semen, i think, then hands the pipe hose
to the seadog who inhales his fill and hands it over
to the travelers in turn. the air smells sweet around us,
the breeze blows it away and brings it back tinged with iodine.
their communion done, they embark except the one who
stands, the dead rooster in his hand, as if wanting
to entrust it to us, then digs a hurried hole to bury it in.
the boat, barely visible, leaves a leaden lacey ribbon
aiming directly for the burnt orange sun. as it reddens,
for a moment, their standing silhouettes eclipse it.
then the sea restores its dominion, dark as the coffee cooling
in our cups. dangling from the vine arbor, the lights reflect
a constellation on the table’s dark top. i trace my fingers among them,
hoping conjecture would shine on the mind’s calculus.
between my unquiet eddies, marcus aurelius,
and the coursing water, the travelers’ moment sails,
its tentacles sewing a rupture i had nursed for too long.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
with thick strokes of ink the sky fills with rain.
pretending to run for cover but secretly praying for more rain.
over the echo of the water, i hear a voice saying my name.
no one in the city moves under the quick sightless rain.
the pages of my notebook soak, then curl. i’ve written:
“yogis opened their mouths for hours to drink the rain.”
the sky is a bowl of dark water, rinsing your face.
the window trembles; liquid glass could shatter into rain.
i am a dark bowl, waiting to be filled.
if i open my mouth now, i could drown in the rain.
i hurry home as though someone is there waiting for me.
the night collapses into your skin. i am the rain.

a minor brush with medicine
in eighty years was all
he’d known.
but this was different.
his right arm limp and slung,
his right leg dead to feeling
and response, he let me spoon him
chicken-broth.
later he said
without self-pity that he’d like
to die.
i bluffed, “the doctors
think that therapy might help you
walk again.”
“they’re liars,
all of them,” he muttered.
bedfast
was never how he hoped to go.
“in bed you think of everything,”
he whispered with a shrug, “you think
of all your life.”
i knew
he meant my mother.
without her
he was never what he might have been,
and everyone who knew him knew it.
nothing could take her place—
not the cars he loved to drive,
not the money he could earn at will,
not the roads he knew by heart
from florida to saranac, not the two
replacement wives who never
measured up.
fed now by family
or strangers, carried to the john,
shaved and changed by hired help,
this independent man turned silent
at the end.
only my wife
could reach him for his private needs.
what no one else could do
for him, he let her do.
she talked to him and held
his hand, the left.
she helped him
bless himself and prayed beside him
as my mother might have done.
“darling” was his final word
for her.
softly, in arabic.

therefore, no more recounting of dreams, a routine thing
that bores with expectations of invention, unfiltered
non sequiturs, unusual embraces
only from the practiced

being a bride, she is changing behind that white curtain
leora

prematurely the pure suckling of a baby

something to do with jasmine

existing only without accident

when she sleeps at night and it is also dark
for the jasmine
four hours
of tea sucking on blossoms, cestrum nocturnum like
colostrums: the earliest secretions, and then only milk
from mother
—there it is
seven times over
jasmine bath after jasmine bath

all the right answers

ps: pastiche, salmagundi when all dressed up
leg and fin share custody
so young men sacrifice only below the belt
to please her
many wounded soldiers
her company
from now on storming the beaches
rocks already aftermath, the breaking of dozens of sphinxes
the taming of sandstone lions and griffins, gargoyles
leora takes to breast anything capable of sucking
and being filled, no ban on leeches and vipers
that stick out like misplaced overdeveloped hairs
and while in position, her free hand
shaves the heads of medusa’s children screaming
for more nursing
with her eyes closed, her free handy blade, sharpened
life line
the liquids of history therefore tend to ferment; the beverages for walks down
memory lane therefore become pungent cheeses and wines, the odes
to bitterness and sweetness happen. this is also desirable. taste depends
on how the glass tilts, how tongue curls.
what’s difficult
is maintaining gaps as gaps. a sustainable nothingness.
but something enters. sustainable nothingness
looks like a niche.
ghosts and spirits of what’s been lost. a young woman looks over her shoulder.
close watching of what’s fading does not mean the change from substance to spirit
would be observed. on the tippy-tips of split tail fin looking over her shoulder
a long line for the nurse, exceptional business, nonstop nursing
and the milk won’t stop, years are at the end of the line.
pull the plug on a nearby respirator (how on earth?)
(don’t assume location, location, location)
the substance travels the line
joins the community of electricity, colonies of gigantic storms
on the sun
and appearances in auroras
that the mermaid sits under as under any canopy
nonstop
the spell of the tide tailored to make the one falling under its influence fall more
willingly. it feels nothing like falling at all: leora describes rehabilitation
sand sparkles remembering having been alive
only once
leora’s eyes
sparkle upon contact with crabs and their incredible redness
that ought to teach her something about fire she does not know
with top-heavy ways
of knowing
(the brain should travel the stations of the body, and one day
the eyes and navel, when the eyes accompany the brain,
line up in a row)
—then a real reason for revision dream on 
accordingly, pureness of the situation milks its own purity
fantastic and looks disgusting
(no matter where the eyes are—candidate
for truth)
but purity is still pure following
such a milking
the mermaid’s pregnancy has to be called immaculate after repeated searches for the
limits. lost without those. pure. last resort and best explanation for birth of a human
baby from a mermaid without a human pelvis or womb. the best xrays
cannot find them. machines arrive on the beach and leave defective.
leora
continues nursing
her baby first in line
the milk is pure. it does not need to be pasteurized. makes(empty)
no one ill. nothing in it allows allergies. the chemistry(empty)
of the milk is pure.(empty)
the molecules of the tabernacle of purity.

probably are smashed pendulums

you move around me expertly like the good, round italian barber i went to in florence, years before we met, his scissors a razor he sharpened on a belt. but at first when you were learning, i feared for my neck, saw my ears like sliced fruit on the newspapered floor. taking us back in time, you cleverly clipped my head in a flat-top. the years in between were styles no one had ever seen, or should see again: when the wind rose half my hair floated off in feathers, the other half bristling, brief as a brush.in the chair, almost asleep, i hear the bright scissors dancing. hear you hum, full-breasted as aida, carefully trimming the white from my temples, so no one, not even i, will know.

not the peace of a cease-fire, not even the vision of the wolf and the lamb, but rather as in the heart when the excitement is over and you can talk only about a great weariness. i know that i know how to kill, that makes me an adult. and my son plays with a toy gun that know show to open and close its eyes and say mama. a peace without the big noise of beating swords into ploughshares, without words, without the thud of the heavy rubber stamp: let it be light, floating, like lazy white foam. a little rest for the wounds—who speaks of healing? (and the howl of the orphans is passed from one generation to the next, as in a relay race: the baton never falls.) let it come like wildflowers, suddenly, because the field must have it: wild peace.

“let’s be the same wound if we must bleed.
let’s fight side by side, even if the enemy
is ourselves: i am yours, you are mine.”
—tommy olofsson, swedeni’m not interested in
who suffered the most.
i’m interested in
people getting over it.
once when my father was a boy
a stone hit him on the head.
hair would never grow there.
our fingers found the tender spot
and its riddle: the boy who has fallen
stands up. a bucket of pears
in his mother’s doorway welcomes him home.
the pears are not crying.
later his friend who threw the stone
says he was aiming at a bird.
and my father starts growing wings.
each carries a tender spot:
something our lives forgot to give us.
a man builds a house and says,
“i am native now.”
a woman speaks to a tree in place
of her son. and olives come.
a child’s poem says,
“i don’t like wars,
they end up with monuments.”
he’s painting a bird with wings
wide enough to cover two roofs at once.
why are we so monumentally slow?
soldiers stalk a pharmacy:
big guns, little pills.
if you tilt your head just slightly
it’s ridiculous.
there’s a place in my brain
where hate won’t grow.
i touch its riddle: wind, and seeds.
something pokes us as we sleep.
it’s late but everything comes next.

erstwhile means long time gone.
a harbinger is sent before to help,
and also a sign of things
to come. like this blue
stapler i bought at staples.
did you know in ancient rome
priests called augurs studied
the future by carefully watching
whether birds were flying
together or alone, making what
honking or beeping noises
in what directions? it was called
the auspices. the air
was thus a huge announcement.
today it’s completely
transparent, a vase. inside it
flowers flower. thus
a little death scent. i have
no master but always wonder,
what is making my master sad?
maybe i do not know him.
this morning i made extra coffee
for the beloved and covered
the cup with a saucer. skeleton
i thought, and stay
very still, whatever it was
will soon pass by and be gone.

i hate the phrase “inner life.” my attic hurts,
and i’d like to quit the committee
for naming tornadoes. do you remember
how easy and sad it was to be young
and defined by our bicycles? my first
was yellow, and though it was no black
phantom or sting-ray but merely a varsity
i loved the afternoon it was suddenly gone,
chasing its apian flash through the neighborhoods
with my father in vain. like being a nuclear
family in a television show totally unaffected
by a distant war. then we returned
to the green living room to watch the no names
hold our over the hill gang under
the monotinted chromatic defeated super
bowl waters. 1973, year of the black fly
caught in my jell-o. year of the suffrage building
on k street nw where a few minor law firms
mingle proudly with the union of butchers
and meat cutters. a black hand
already visits my father in sleep, moving
up his spine to touch his amygdala. i will
never know a single thing anyone feels,
just how they say it, which is why i am standing
here exactly, covered in shame and lightning,
doing what i’m supposed to do.

drunker than voyager i
but not as voyager 2 i rode my blue

to my lonely geode cave of light
awaiting nothing under the punctured

velocity drinking clear liquid starlight
at the thunderbird with a fingerless
russian hedge fund inspector and one
who called himself the champ. all
night i felt fine crystals cutting
my lips like rising up through
a hailstorm. and the great vacuum
cleaner that cannot be filled moved
through my chest, gathering

one of many silences the champ
took off his face and thus were many

the word which used to mean in truth
but now expresses disbelief. so
quickly did my future come. you who
are floating past me on your inward way,

today in el paso all the planes are asleep on the runway. the world
is in a delay. all the political consultants drinking whiskey keep
their heads down, lifting them only to look at the beautiful scarred
waitress who wears typewriter keys as a necklace. they jingle
when she brings them drinks. outside the giant plate glass windows
the planes are completely covered in snow, it piles up on the wings.
i feel like a mountain of cell phone chargers. each of the various
faiths of our various fathers keeps us only partly protected. i don’t
want to talk on the phone to an angel. at night before i go to sleep
i am already dreaming. of coffee, of ancient generals, of the faces
of statues each of which has the eternal expression of one of my feelings.
i examine my feelings without feeling anything. i ride my blue bike
on the edge of the desert. i am president of this glass of water.

in his life he
didn’t cut down a single tree,
didn’t slit the throat

in his life he did not speak

didn’t raise
his voice to a soul
except in his saying:
“come in, please,

his case is hopeless,

the street is empty
as a monk’s memory,

like acorns—
and the dead crowd the horizon

no vein can bleed

no scream will rise

we will not leave! everyone outside is waiting
for the trucks and the cars

we will not leave!
the shields of light are breaking apart

outside, everyone wants us to leave.
but we will not leave! ivory white brides
behind their veils

and everyone outside wants us to leave,
but we will not leave! the big guns pound the jujube groves,
destroying the dreams of the violets,
extinguishing bread, killing the salt,
unleashing thirst
and parching lips and souls.
and everyone outside is saying:
“what are we waiting for?
warmth we’re denied,
the air itself has been seized!
why aren’t we leaving?”
masks fill the pulpits and brothels,
the places of ablution.
masks cross-eyed with utter amazement;
they do not believe what is now so clear,
and fall, astonished,
writhing like worms, or tongues.
we will not leave! are we in the inside only to leave?
leaving is just for the masks,
for pulpits and conventions.
leaving is just
for the siege-that-comes-from-within,
the siege that comes from the bedouin’s loins,
the siege of the brethren
tarnished by the taste of the blade

you asked me once,
on our way back
from the midmorning
trip to the spring:
“what do you hate,
and who do you love?” and i answered,
from behind the eyelashes
of my surprise,
my blood rushing
like the shadow
cast by a cloud of starlings:
“i hate departure . . .
i love the spring
and the path to the spring,
and i worship the middle
hours of morning.”
and you laughed . . .
and the almond tree blossomed
and the thicket grew loud with nightingales.. . . a question
now four decades old:
i salute that question’s answer;
and an answer
as old as your departure;
i salute that answer’s question . . .and today,
it’s preposterous,
here we are at a friendly airport
by the slimmest of chances,
and we meet.
ah, lord!
we meet.
and here you are
asking—again,
it’s absolutely preposterous—
i recognized you
but you didn’t recognize me.
“is it you?!”
but you wouldn’t believe it.
and suddenly
you burst out and asked:
“if you’re really you,
what do you hate
and who do you love?!”and i answered—
my blood
fleeing the hall,
rushing in me
like the shadow
cast by a cloud of starlings:
“i hate departure,
and i love the spring,
and the path to the spring,
and i worship the middle
hours of morning.” and you wept,
and flowers bowed their heads,
and doves in the silk of their sorrow stumbled.

after knowledge extinguished the last of the beautiful
fires our worship had failed to prolong, we walked
back home through pedestrian daylight, to a residence humbler than the one left behind. a door without mystery,
a room without theme. for the hour that we spend
complacent at the window overlooking the garden, we observe an arrangement in rust and gray-green,
a vagueness at the center whose slow, persistent
movements some sentence might explain if we had time or strength for sentences. to admit that what falls
falls solitarily, lost in the permanent dusk of the particular.
that the mind that fear and disenchantment fatten comes to boss the world around it, morbid as the damp-
fingered guest who rearranges the cheeses the minute the host
turns to fix her a cocktail. a disease of the will, the way false birch branches arch and interlace from which
hands dangle last leaf-parchments and a very large array
of primitive bird-shapes. their pasted feathers shake in the aftermath of the nothing we will ever be content
to leave the way we found it. i love that about you.
i love that when i call you on the long drab days practicality keeps one of us away from the other that i am calling
a person so beautiful to me that she has seen my awkwardness
on the actual sidewalk but she still answers anyway. i say that when i fell you fell beside me and the concrete
refused to apologize. that a sparrow sat for a spell
on the windowsill today to communicate the new intelligence. that the goal of objectivity depends upon one’s faith
in the accuracy of one’s perceptions, which is to say
a confidence in the purity of the perceiving instrument. i won’t be dying after all, not now, but will go on living dizzily
hereafter in reality, half-deaf to reality, in the room
perfumed by the fire that our inextinguishable will begins.

1the clouds part revealing a mythology of clouds
assembled in light of earliest birds, an originary
text over water over time, and that without which the clouds part revealing an apology for clouds
implicit in the air where the clouds had been
recently witnessed rehearsing departure, a heartfelt phrase in the push of the airborne drops and crystals
over water over time—how being made to think
oneself an obstruction between the observer and the object or objects under surveillance or even
desired—or if i am felt to be beside the point
then i have wanted that, but to block a path is like not being immaterial enough, or being too much
when all they want from you now is your station
cleared of its personal effects please and vanish—not that they’d ever just come out and say it when
all that darting around of the eyes, all that shaky
camouflage of paper could only portend the beginning of the end of your tenure at this organization, and remember
a capacity to draw meaning out of such seeming
accidence landed one here to begin with, didn’t it.2the clouds part revealing an anatomy of clouds
viewed from the midst of human speculation, a business
project undertaken in a bid to acquire and retain control of the formation and movement of clouds.
as late afternoons i have witnessed the distant
towers borrow luster from a bourbon sun, in-box empty, surround sound on, all my money made
in lieu of conversation—where conversation indicates
the presence of desire in the parties to embark on exchange of spirit, hours forzando with heartfelt phrase—
made metaphor for it, the face on the clock tower
bright as a meteor, as if a torch were held against likelihood to illuminate the time so i could watch
the calm silent progress of its hands from the luxury
appointments of my office suite, the tumult below or behind me out of mind, had not my whole attention
been riveted by the human figure stood upon
the tower’s topmost pinnacle, himself surveying the clouds of the future parting in antiquity, a figure
not to be mistaken, tranquilly pacing a platform
with authority: the chief executive officer of clouds.3the clouds part revealing blueprints of the clouds
built in glass-front factories carved into cliff-faces
which, prior to the factories’ recent construction, provided dorms for clans of hamadryas baboons,
a species revered in ancient egypt as attendants
of thoth, god of wisdom, science, and measurement. fans conveying clouds through aluminum ducts
can be heard from up to a mile away, depending on
air temperature, humidity, the absence or presence of any competing sound, its origin and its character.
it is no more impossible to grasp the baboon’s
full significance in egyptian religious symbolism than it is to determine why clouds we manufacture
provoke in an audience more positive, lasting
response than do comparable clouds occurring in nature. even those who consider natural clouds products
of conscious manufacture seem to prefer that a merely
human mind lie behind the products they admire. this development may be a form of self-exalting
or else another adaptation in order that we find
the hum of machinery comforting through darkness.4the clouds part revealing there’s no place left to sit
myself down except for a single wingback chair
backed into a corner to face the window in which the clouds part revealing the insouciance of clouds
cavorting over the backs of the people in the field
who cut the ripened barley, who gather it in sheaves, who beat grain from the sheaves with wooden flails,
who shake it loose from the scaly husk around it,
who throw the now threshed grain up into the gently palm-fanned air whose steady current carries off
the chaff as the grain falls to the floor, who collect
the grain from the floor painstakingly to grind it into flour, who bake the flour into loaves the priest will offer
in the sanctuary, its walls washed white like milk.
to perform it repeatedly, to perform it each time as if the first, to walk the dim corridor believing that
the conference it leads to might change everything,
to adhere to a possibility of reward, of betterment, of moving above, with effort, the condition into which
one has been born, to whom do i owe the pleasure
of the hum to which i have been listening too long.5the clouds part revealing the advocates of clouds,
believers in people, ideas and things, the workers
of the united fields of clouds, supporters of the wars to keep clouds safe, the devotees of heartfelt phrase
and belief you can change with water over time.
it is the habit of a settled population to give ear to whatever is desirable will come to pass, a caressing
confidence—but one unfortunately not borne out
by human experience, for most things people desire have been desired ardently for thousands of years
and observe—they are no closer to realization today
than in ramses’ time. nor is there cause to believe they will lose their coyness on some near tomorrow.
attempts to speed them on have been undertaken
from the beginning; plans to force them overnight are in copious, antagonistic operation today, and yet
they have thoroughly eluded us, and chances are
they will continue to elude us until the clouds part in a flash of autonomous, ardent, local brainwork—
but when the clouds start to knit back together again,
we’ll dismiss the event as a glitch in transmission.6the clouds part revealing a congregation of bodies
united into one immaterial body, a fictive person
around whom the air is blurred with money, force from which much harm will come, to whom my welfare
matters nothing. i sense without turning the light
from their wings, their eyes; they preen themselves on the fire escape, the windowsill, their pink feet
vulnerable—a mistake to think of them that way.
if i turn around, the room might not be full of wings capable of acting, in many respects, as a single being,
which is to say that i myself may be the source of
what i sense, but am no less powerless to change it. always around me, on my body, in my mouth, i fear them
and their love of money, everything i do without
thinking to help them make it. and if i am felt to be beside the point, i have wanted that, to live apart
from what depends on killing me a little bit to keep
itself alive, and yet not happily, with all its needs and comforts met, but fattened so far past that point
i am engrossed, and if i picture myself outside of it
it isn’t me anymore, but a parasite cast out, inviable.7the clouds part revealing the distinction between
words without meaning and meaning without words,
a phenomenon of nature, the westbound field of low air pressure developing over water over time
and warm, saturated air on the sea surface rising
steadily replaced by cold air from above, the cycle repeating, the warm moving upward into massive
thunderclouds, the cold descending into the eye
around which bands of thunderclouds spiral, counter-clockwise, often in the hundreds, the atmospheric
pressure dropping even further, making winds
accelerate, the clouds revolve, a confusion of energy, an incomprehensible volume of rain—i remember
the trick of thinking through infinity, a crowd of eyes
against an asphalt wall, my vision of it scrolling left as the crowd thinned out to a spatter and then
just black until i fall asleep and then just black again,
past marketing, past focus groups, past human resources, past management, past personal effects,
their insignificance evident in the eye of the dream
and through much of the debriefing i wake into next.

that figure in the cellarage you hear upsetting boxes
is an antic of the mind, a baroque imp cobbled
up under bulbs whose flickering perplexes night’s impecunious craftsman, making what he makes
turn out irregular, awry, every effort botched
in its own wrong way. you belong, i said, laid out chalk-white between a layer of tautened cotton gauze
and another of the selfsame rubbish that you are
wreaking havoc on tonight—and it didn’t disagree. what’s more, i said, you are amiss in this ad hoc quest
for origin and purpose. whatever destiny it is
you are meant to aspire to before you retire to that soup-bowl of oblivion such figments as we
expect to find final rest in couldn’t possibly be
contained in these boxes. and again—no contest. and when i was in need, i said, you raveled off
in the long-winded ploys of a winless october,
unfaithful to the one whose instincts had devised you . . .—at this, the figure dropped the box from its hands,
turned down a dock i remembered and wept.
i followed it down there, sat beside it and wept. looking out on the water in time we came to see
being itself had made things fall apart this way.
we envied the simplicity implicit in sea-sponges and similar marine life, their resistance to changes
across millennia we took to be deliberate, an art
practiced untheatrically beneath the water’s surface. we admired the example the whole sea set, actually.
maritime pauses flew like gulls in our exchanges.
we wondered that much longer before we had left.

pity the selfsame vehicle that spirits me away from
factories of tedium should likewise serve to drag
me backwards into panic, or that panic should erect massive factories of its own, their virulent pollutants
havocking loved waterways, frothing all the reed-
fringed margins acid pink and gathering in the shell and soft tissues of the snails unknowingly in danger
as they inch up stems. through the bulkhead door
i can hear their spirals plunk into the sluggish south-bound current and dissolve therein with such brutal
regularity their dying has given rise to the custom
of measuring time here in a unit known as the snails death. the snails death refers to the average length of time,
about 43 seconds, elapsing between the loss of the first
snail to toxic waters and the loss of the next, roughly equivalent to the pause between swallows in a human
throat, while the adverb here refers to my person
and all its outskirts, beginning on the so-called cellular level extending more of less undaunted all the way down
to the vale at the foot of the bed. i often fear i’ll wake
to find you waiting there and won’t know how to speak on the subject of my production, or rather my woeful
lack thereof, but in your absence, once again, i will begin
drafting apologies in a language ineffectual as doves.
daybreak on my marshland: a single egret, blotched,
trudges through the froth. i take its photograph
from the rooftop observation deck from which i watch day’s delivery trucks advance. i take advantage of
the quiet before their arrival to organize my thoughts
on the paranormal thusly: (1) if the human psyche has proven spirited enough to produce such a range
of material effects upon what we’ll call the closed
system of its custodial body, indeed if it’s expected to, and (2) if such effects might be thought to constitute
the physical expression of that psyche, an emanation
willed into matter in a manner not unlike a brand-new car or cream-filled cake or disposable camera,
and (3) if the system of the body can be swapped out
for another, maybe an abandoned factory or a vale, then might it not also prove possible for the psyche
by aptitude or lather or sheer circumstance to impress
its thumbprint on some other system, a production in the basement, or in a video store, as when i find you
inching up steps or down a shady aisle or pathway,
dragging your long chains behind you most morosely if you ask me, the question is: did you choose this, or was it
imposed on you, but even as i ask your hands move
wildly about your throat to indicate you cannot speak.3after the memory of the trucks withdrawing heavy
with their cargo fans out and fades into late-morning
hunger, i relocate in time to the lit bank of vending machines still humming in the staff-room corner for a light
meal of cheese curls, orange soda, and what history
will come to mourn as the last two cream-filled cakes. eating in silence, a breeze in the half-light, absently
thinking of trying not to think, i imagine the bethlehem
steel smokestacks above me piping nonstop, the skywide open without any question, steam and dioxides
of carbon and sulfur, hands pressed to the wall as i walk
down the corridor to stop myself from falling awake again on the floor in embarrassment. if there’s any use
of imagination more productive or time less painful
it hasn’t tried hard enough to push through to find me wandering the wings of a ghost-run factory as earth
approaches the dark vale cut in the heart of the galaxy.
taking shots of the sunbaked fields of putrefaction visible from the observation deck. hoping to capture
what i can point to as the way it feels. sensing my hand
in what i push away. watching it dissolve into plumes rising like aerosols, or like ghosts of indigenous peoples,
or the lump in the throat to keep me from saying that
surviving almost everything has felt like having killed it.4(plunk) up from the floor with the sun to the sound of
dawn’s first sacrifice to the residues of commerce.
on autofog, on disbelief: rejuvenation in a boxer brief crashed three miles wide in the waves off madagascar,
cause of great flooding in the bible and in gilgamesh.
massive sphere of rock and ice, of all events in history(plunk) thought to be the lethalmost. a snails death
semiquavers from pang to ghost where the habit of ghosts
of inhabiting timepieces, of conniving their phantom tendrils through parlor air and into the escapements
of some inoperative heirloom clock on a mantel shows
not the dead’s ongoing interest in their old adversary(plunk) time so much as an urge to return to the hard
mechanical kind of being. an erotic lounging to reanimate
the long-inert pendulum. as i have felt you banging nights in my machine, jostling the salt from a pretzel.
this passion for the material realm after death however
refuses to be reconciled with a willingness to destroy(plunk) it while alive. when the last of the human voices
told me what i had to do, they rattled off a shopping
list of artifacts they wanted thrown down open throats. that left me feeling in on it, chosen, a real fun-time guy
albeit somewhat sleep-deprived; detail-oriented, modern,
yes, but also dubious, maudlin, bedridden, speechless.5graffiti on the stonework around the service entrance
makes the doorway at night look like the mystagogic
mouth of a big beast, amphibious, outfitted with fangs, snout, the suggestion of a tongue, throat, and alimentary
canal leading to a complex of caves, tunnels, temples . . .
there are rooms i won’t enter, at whose threshold i say this is as far as i go, no farther, almost as if i can sense
there’s something in there i don’t want to see, or for which
to see means having wanted already to forget, unless stepping into the mouth at last, pressed into its damp,
the advantage of not knowing is swapped out for the loss
of apartness from what you’d held unknown, meaning you don’t come to know it so much as become it, wholly
warping into its absorbent fold. i can’t let that happen
if it hasn’t already. what draws me on might be thought canine, keen-sighted, but it’s still incapable of divining why
the constant hum around or inside me has to choose
among being a nocturne of toxic manufacture, the call of what remains of the jungle, or else just another prank
on my gullible anatomy. am i not beset in the utmost
basement of industry? is that basement itself not beset by the broad, black-green, waxy leaves of mesoamerica?
and haven’t i parted those selfsame leaves, discovering me
asleep on my own weapon, threat to no one but myself?6asked again what i miss the most about my former life,
i remember to pause this time, look left, a little off-camera
an entire snailsdeath, an air of sifting the possibilities, i eliminate certain objects and events from the running
right off the bat, such as when their great displeasure
brought the gods to turn to darkness all that had been light, submerging mountaintops in stormwater, the gods
shocked by their own power, and heartsick to watch
their once dear people stippling the surf like little fishes. or when the flaming peccary of a comet struck the earth
with much the same effect, waves as high as ziggurats
crashing mathematically against our coastlines, scalding plumes of vapor and aerosols tossed into the atmosphere
spawning storms to pummel the far side of the earth,
approximately 80 percent of all life vanished in a week. or when we squandered that very earth and shat on it
with much the same effect, and more or less on purpose,
emitting nonstop gases in the flow of our production, shoveling it in as ancient icecaps melted, what difference
could another make now. and so i clear my throat, look
directly into the camera, and even though it will make me come off bovine in their eyes, i say that what i miss the most
has to be those cream-filled cakes i used to like, but then
they prod me with their volts and lead me back to the barn.7after the panic grew more of less customary, the pity
dissolved into a mobile fogbank, dense, reducing visibility
from the rooftop observation deck. mobile in the sense that it possessed mobility, not in the sense that it actually
moved. because it didn’t. it just stayed there, reducing
visibility but not in the sense that it simply diminished it or diminished it partly. because it didn’t. it pretty much
managed to do away with it altogether, as my photography
will come to show: field after field of untouched white. after the possibility of change grew funny, threadbare,
too embarrassing to be with, i eased into the knowledge
that you’d never appear at the foot of the bed, the vale turned into a lifetime’s heap of laundry, and not the gentle
tuffets and streambanks of an afterlife it seems we only
imagined remembering, that watercolor done in greensand about which i predicted its monotony of fair weather
over time might deaden one all over again, unless being
changed with death means not only changing past change but past even the wish for it. i worried to aspire towards
that condition might actually dull one’s aptitude for change.
that i would grow to protect what i wished to keep from change at the cost of perpetuating much that required it.
in this sense i had come to resemble the fogbank, at once
given to motion but no less motionless than its photograph. the last time i saw myself alive, i drew the curtain back
from the bed, stood by my sleeping body. i felt tenderness
towards it. i knew how long it had waited, and how little time remained for it to prepare its bundle of grave-goods.
when i tried to speak, rather than my voice, my mouth
released the tight, distinctive shriek of an aerophone of clay. i wanted to stop the shock of that from taking away from
what i felt. i couldn’t quite manage it. even at this late hour,
even here, the purity of a feeling is ruined by the world.8the noises from the basement were not auspicious noises.
i wanted to live forever. i wanted to live forever and die
right then and there. i had heard the tight, distinctive shriek. here again and now. i no longer have legs. i am sleeping.
long tendrils of tobacco smoke, composed of carbon dioxide,
water vapor, ammonia, nitrogen oxide, hydrogen cyanide, and 4,000 other chemical compounds, penetrate the room
through the gap beneath the door and through heating vents
with confidence. they are the spectral forms of anaconda. the ruler of the underworld smokes cigars. a certain brand.
hand-rolled. he smiles as if there is much to smile about.
and there is. he is hollow-eyed, toothless. his hat, infamous: broad-brimmed, embellished with feathers, a live macaw.
his cape is depicted, often, as a length of fabric in distinctive
black and white chevrons. otherwise, as here, the full pelt of a jaguar. on a barge of plywood and empty milk cartons
he trudges through the froth. he is the lord of black sorcery
and lord of percussion. he is patron of commerce. he parts the leaves of mesoamerica, traveling with a retinue of drunken
ax wielders, collection agents. his scribe is a white rabbit.
daughter of moon and of night. elsewhere, you are having your teeth taken out. there is no music left, but i still feel held
captive by the cinema, and in its custom, i believe myself
capable of protecting myself by hiding my face in my hands.

i slid the white louvers shut so i could stand in your closet a little while among the throng of flowered dresses you hadn’t worn in years, and touch the creases on each of their sleeves that smelled of forgiveness and even though you would still be alive a few more days i knew they were ready to let themselves be packed into liquor store boxes simply because you had asked that of them, and dropped at the door of the salvation army without having noticed me wrapping my arms around so many at once that one slipped a big padded shoulder off of its hanger as if to return the embrace.

what does not change / is the will to change
he woke, fully clothed, in his bed. he
remembered only one thing, the birds, how
when he came in, he had gone around the rooms
and got them back in their cage, the green one first,
she with the bad leg, and then the blue,
the one they had hoped was a male otherwise? yes, fern and, who had talked lispingly of albers & angkor vat.
he had left the party without a word. how he got up, got into his coat,
i do not know. when i saw him, he was at the door, but it did not matter,
he was already sliding along the wall of the night, losing himself
in some crack of the ruins. that it should have been he who said, “the kingfishers!
who cares
for their feathers
now?” his last words had been, “the pool is slime.” suddenly everyone,
ceasing their talk, sat in a row around him, watched
they did not so much hear, or pay attention, they
wondered, looked at each other, smirked, but listened,
he repeated and repeated, could not go beyond his thought
“the pool
the kingfishers’ feathers were wealth
why
did the export stop?” it was then he left
i thought of the e on the stone, and of what mao said

he got the color of his breast
from the heat of the setting sun! the features are, the feebleness of the feet (syndactylism of the 3rd & 4th digit)
the bill, serrated, sometimes a pronounced beak, the wings
where the color is, short and round, the tail
inconspicuous. but not these things were the factors. not the birds.
the legends are
legends. dead, hung up indoors, the kingfisher
will not indicate a favoring wind,
or avert the thunderbolt. nor, by its nesting,
still the waters, with the new year, for seven days.
it is true, it does nest with the opening year, but not on the waters.
it nests at the end of a tunnel bored by itself in a bank. there,
six or eight white and translucent eggs are laid, on fishbones
not on bare clay, on bones thrown up in pellets by the birds. on these rejectamenta
(as they accumulate they form a cup-shaped structure) the young are born.
and, as they are fed and grow, this nest of excrement and decayed fish becomes

it was for the honour of the army.

i didn’t know what it was
but i thought:
this is pretty bloody damn fine.

he killed a prussian and he lay in the street

he was a middy in those days,

and they saw a procession coming down through
a cut in the hills, carrying something
the six chaps in front carrying a long thing
on their shoulders,
and they thought it was a funeral,
but the thing was wrapped up in scarlet,
and he put off in the cutter,
he was a middy in those days,
to see what the natives were doing,
and they got up to the six fellows in livery,
and they looked at it, and i can still hear the old admiral,
“was it? it was

with a lot of kids of sixteen,
howling and crying for their mamas,
and he sent a chit back to his major:
i can hold out for ten minutes
with my sergeant and a machine-gun.
and they rebuked him for levity.
and henri gaudier went to it,
and they killed him,
and killed a good deal of sculpture,
and ole t.e.h. he went to it,
with a lot of books from the library,
london library, and a shell buried ‘em in a dug-out,
and the library expressed its annoyance.
and a bullet hit him on the elbow
…gone through the fellow in front of him,
and he read kant in the hospital, in wimbledon,
in the original,
and the hospital staff didn’t like it. and wyndham lewis went to it,
with a heavy bit of artillery,
and the airmen came by with a mitrailleuse,
and cleaned out most of his company,
and a shell lit on his tin hut,
while he was out in the privy,
and he was all there was left of that outfit. windeler went to it,
and he was out in the ægæan,
and down in the hold of his ship
pumping gas into a sausage,
and the boatswain looked over the rail,
down into amidships, and he said:
gees! look a’ the kept’n,
the kept’n’s a-gettin’ ‘er up. and ole captain baker went to it,
with his legs full of rheumatics,
so much so he couldn’t run,
so he was six months in hospital,
observing the mentality of the patients. and fletcher was 19 when he went to it,
and his major went mad in the control pit,
about midnight, and started throwing the ‘phone about
and he had to keep him quiet
till abut six in the morning,
and direct that bunch of artillery. and ernie hemingway went to it,
too much in a hurry,

and all the time, there were people going
down there, over the river. there was a man there talking,
to a thousand, just a short speech, and
then move ‘em on.
and he said:
yes, these people, they are all right, they
can do everything, everything except act;
and go an’ hear ‘em but when they are through
come to the bolsheviki…and when it broke, there was the crowd there,
and the cossacks, just as always before,
but one thing, the cossacks said:
“pojalouista.”
and that got round in the crowd,
and then a lieutenant of infantry
ordered ‘em to fire into the crowd,
in the square at the end of the nevsky,
in front of the moscow station,
and they wouldn’t,
and he pulled his sword on a student for laughing,
and killed him,
and a cossack rode out of his squad
on the other side of the square
and cut down the lieutenant of infantry
and there was the revolution…
as soon as they named it. and you can’t make ‘em,
nobody knew it was coming. they were all ready, the old gang,
guns on the top of the post-office and the palace,
but none of the leaders knew it was coming. and there were some killed at the barracks,
but that was between the troops.so we used to hear it at the opera
that they wouldn’t be under haig;
and that the advance was beginning;
that it was going to begin in a week.

a lady asks me
i speak in season
she seeks reason for an affect, wild often
that is so proud he hath love for a name
who denys it can hear the truth now
wherefore i speak to the present knowers
having no hope that low-hearted
can bring sight to such reason
be there not natural demonstration
i have no will to try proof-bringing
or say where it hath birth
what is its virtu and power
its being and every moving
or delight whereby ‘tis called “to love”
or if man can show it to sight. where memory liveth,
it takes its state
formed like a diafan from light on shade
which shadow cometh of mars and remaineth
created, having a name sensate,
custom of the soul,
will from the heart;
cometh from a seen form which being understood
taketh locus and remaining in the intellect possible
wherein hath he neither weight nor still-standing,
descendeth not by quality but shineth out
himself his own effect unendingly
not in delight but in the being aware
nor can he leave his true likeness otherwhere. he is not vertu but cometh of that perfection
which is so postulate not by the reason
but ‘tis felt, i say.
beyond salvation, holdeth his judging force
deeming intention to be reason’s peer and mate,
poor in discernment, being thus weakness’ friend
often his power cometh on death in the end,
be it withstayed
and so swinging counterweight.
not that it were natural opposite, but only
wry’d a bit from the perfect,
let no man say love cometh from chance
or hath not established lordship
holding his power even though
memory hath him no more. cometh he to be
when the will
from overplus
twisteth out of natural measure,
never adorned with rest moveth he changing colour
either to laugh or weep
contorting the face with fear
resteth but a little
yet shall ye see of him that he is most often
with folk who deserve him
and his strange quality sets sighs to move
willing man look into that forméd trace in his mind
and with such uneasiness as rouseth the flame.
unskilled can not form his image,
he himself moveth not, drawing all to his stillness,
neither turneth about to seek his delight
nor yet to see out proving
be it so great or so small. he draweth likeness and hue from like nature
so making pleasure more certain in seeming
nor can stand hid in such nearness,
beautys be darts tho’ not savage
skilled from such fear a man follows
deserving spirit, that pierceth.
nor is he known from his face
but taken in the white light that is allness
toucheth his aim
who heareth, seeth not form
but is led by its emanation
being divided, set out from colour,
disjunct in mid darkness
grazeth the light, one moving by other,
being divided, divided from all falsity
worthy of trust
from him alone mercy proceedeth. go, song, surely thou mayest
whither it please thee
for so art thou ornate that thy reasons
shall be praised from thy understanders,
with others hast thou no will to make company. “called thrones, balascio or topaze”

on the volatile nights of a winter
nature corroborates with magnanimity
a cuban is in training for amusement or amnesia,
so often and unfairly assumed as the same,
he brings candy to god, he cultivates the vernacular, he fights off
cirrhosis with fruit poached in syrup, he conducts business;
thus research has shown that the cuban is resourceful.
in the weighty choreographies of a summer
nature authorizes already with suspicion
a cuban meets the ocean with offerings and harpoons,
so often and unfairly assumed as the same,
he finger-counts the casualties, he commits an infraction
he slides his hands into his pockets, he avows and commits;
thus analysis has shown that the cuban is inspired.
let’s attend the improbable territory
where with pasty mouths a cuban and the cuban engage in virile
conversation
we will learn there by what voyage, by what strange condition
by what exchange
we fall prey to so much ingenuity.

when one isn’t enough, you need two
when two aren’t enough, you need four
with four the progression begins, moving toward a number
that schoolteachers will call absurd.
question: how many men do you need
to put up a house?
answer: you need absurd men
when one isn’t enough and two can’t do
the work of one.
and how much money should we give these men
to compensate them?
you need absurd coins when one coin
sliced in half and handed out
isn’t enough.
and how many words do you need to
transform them?
absurd and absurd and absurd words
when silence isn’t enough.
this is what they call progression:
absurd men aren’t enough for putting up the house,
absurd coins don’t make them happy
absurd words can’t dissuade them.

from far away in itself
to the hush of the morning
so this is the sound of you
here and now whether or not
anyone hears it this is
where we have come with our age

and our hopes such as they are
invisible before us
untouched and still possible

--i didn’t know she was coming today.
--she was sweet at 4 a.m., bryant says. they had the first conversation about the shirt then.
--israel sends more ground troops into lebanon. there’s an opportunity there, we read in the washington post.
--i don’t like you. i don’t like them. i don’t like them either. and susan? she laughs.
--compare and contrast the acquisition of a language to its loss. avoid the trap of merely saying that the latter happens in reverse order of the former. you are likely to do better if you see them as similar processes, though one leads to gain, the other loss. think chemistry. think performance of a script. think harold and the purple crayon. think harold pinter.
--think two old men fishing for a beautiful young woman in a lake. think one of them might get “lucky.”
--when are you leaving? where are you going? are you taking the kids?
--sangha and may hatch plots of their own. go quiet when i arrive. in this life, you either make plots or have them hatched around you. like eggs. like poisoned ones.

it’s like i thought it would be.
absolute silence.
just me and my poem.
but,
as i stand onstage
preparing to start,
i realize the audience is quiet
because they want to hear me.
silence isn’t scary.
it’s like mr. carey said,
silence is my chance.
and so i speak,
slowly
and clearly,
and i don’t see
the faces in front of me.
i see the images of my poem,
and i think only of what i’m saying
and how much it means to me.
my voice grows stronger
and i don’t have to struggle
to remember the words.i know them
because i wrote them.

night is awake in the dark night tumbles in velvet directions
tumbles along to your bed

wagging your worries

it was a good idea, cutting away the vines and ivy, trimming back the chest-high thicket lazy years had let grow here. though it wasn’t for lack of love for the trees, i’d like to point out. years love trees in a way we can’t imagine. they just don’t use the fruit like us; they want instead the slant of sun through narrow branches, the buckshot of rain on these old cherries. and we, now that i think on it, want those things too, we just always and desperately want the sugar of the fruit, the best we’ll get from this irascible land: sweetness we can gather for years, new stains staining the stains on our hands.

for part of one strange year we lived in a small house at the edge of a wood. no neighbors, which suited us. nobody to ask questions. except for the one big question we went on asking ourselves. that spring myriads of birds stopped over briefly. birds we’d never seen before, drawn to our leafy quiet and our brook and because, as we later learned, the place lay beneath a flyway. flocks appeared overnight—birds brilliant or dull, with sharp beaks or crossed bills, birds small and enormous, all of them pausing to gorge at the feeder, to rest their wings, and disappear. each flock seemed surer than we of a destination. by the time we’d watched them wing north in spring, then make an anxious autumn return, we too had pulled it together and we too moved into what seemed to be our lives.

said the duck to the kangaroo,
‘good gracious! how you hop! over the fields and the water too,
as if you never would stop! my life is a bore in this nasty pond, and i long to go out in the world beyond!
i wish i could hop like you!’
said the duck to the kangaroo.
‘please give me a ride on your back!’
said the duck to the kangaroo. ‘i would sit quite still, and say nothing but “quack,”
the whole of the long day through! and we’d go to the dee, and the jelly bo lee, over the land, and over the sea;—
please take me a ride! o do!’
said the duck to the kangaroo.
said the kangaroo to the duck,
‘this requires some little reflection; perhaps on the whole it might bring me luck,
and there seems but one objection, which is, if you’ll let me speak so bold, your feet are unpleasantly wet and cold, and would probably give me the roo-
matiz!’ said the kangaroo.
said the duck, ‘as i sate on the rocks,
i have thought over that completely, and i bought four pairs of worsted socks
which fit my web-feet neatly. and to keep out the cold i’ve bought a cloak, and every day a cigar i’ll smoke,
all to follow my own dear true
love of a kangaroo!’
said the kangaroo, ‘i’m ready!
all in the moonlight pale; but to balance me well, dear duck, sit steady!
and quite at the end of my tail!’ so away they went with a hop and a bound, and they hopped the whole world three times round;
and who so happy,—o who,

the water it soon came in, it did,
the water it soon came in; so to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet in a pinky paper all folded neat,
and they fastened it down with a pin. and they passed the night in a crockery-jar, and each of them said, ‘how wise we are! though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long, yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,
while round in our sieve we spin!’ far and few, far and few, are the lands where the jumblies live; their heads are green, and their hands are blue, and they went to sea in a sieve.
and all night long they sailed away;
and when the sun went down, they whistled and warbled a moony song to the echoing sound of a coppery gong,
in the shade of the mountains brown. ‘o timballo! how happy we are, when we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar, and all night long in the moonlight pale, we sail away with a pea-green sail,
in the shade of the mountains brown!’ far and few, far and few, are the lands where the jumblies live; their heads are green, and their hands are blue, and they went to sea in a sieve.
they sailed to the western sea, they did,
to a land all covered with trees, and they bought an owl, and a useful cart, and a pound of rice, and a cranberry tart,
and a hive of silvery bees. and they bought a pig, and some green jack-daws, and a lovely monkey with lollipop paws, and forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,
and no end of stilton cheese. far and few, far and few, are the lands where the jumblies live; their heads are green, and their hands are blue, and they went to sea in a sieve.
and in twenty years they all came back,
in twenty years or more, and every one said, ‘how tall they’ve grown!’ for they’ve been to the lakes, and the torrible zone,
and the hills of the chankly bore; and they drank their health, and gave them a feast of dumplings made of beautiful yeast; and everyone said, ‘if we only live, we too will go to sea in a sieve,—
to the hills of the chankly bore!’ far and few, far and few, are the lands where the jumblies live; their heads are green, and their hands are blue, and they went to sea in a sieve.

from golden showers of the ancient skies,
on the first day, and the eternal snow of stars,
you once unfastened giant calyxes
for the young earth still innocent of scars: young gladioli with the necks of swans,
laurels divine, of exiled souls the dream,
vermilion as the modesty of dawns
trod by the footsteps of the seraphim; the hyacinth, the myrtle gleaming bright,
and, like the flesh of woman, the cruel rose,
hérodiade blooming in the garden light,
she that from wild and radiant blood arose! and made the sobbing whiteness of the lily
that skims a sea of sighs, and as it wends
through the blue incense of horizons, palely
toward the weeping moon in dreams ascends! hosanna on the lute and in the censers,
lady, and of our purgatorial groves!
through heavenly evenings let the echoes answer,
sparkling haloes, glances of rapturous love! mother, who in your strong and righteous bosom,
formed calyxes balancing the future flask,
capacious flowers with the deadly balsam
for the weary poet withering on the husk.

ancient overture of hé﻿rodiade the nurse
(incantation)abolished, and her frightful wing in the tears
of the basin, abolished, that mirrors forth our fears,
the naked golds lashing the crimson space,
an aurora—heraldic plumage—has chosen to embrace
our cinerary tower of sacrifice,
heavy tomb that a songbird has fled, lone caprice
of a dawn vainly decked out in ebony plumes…
ah, mansion this sad, fallen country assumes!
no splashing! the gloomy water, standing still,
no longer visited by snowy quill
or fabled swan, reflects the bereaving
of autumn extinguished by its own unleaving,
of the swan when amidst the cold white tomb
of its feathers, it buried its head, undone
by the pure diamond of a star, but one
of long ago, which never even shone. crime! torture! ancient dawn! bright pyre!
empurpled sky, complicit in the mire,
and stained-glass windows opening red on carnage. the strange chamber, framed in all the baggage
of a warlike age, its goldwork dull and faint,
has yesteryear’s snows instead of its ancient tint;
and its pearl-gray tapestry, useless creases
with the buried eyes of prophetesses
offering magi withered fingers. one,
with floral past enwoven on my gown
bleached in an ivory chest and with a sky
bestrewn with birds amidst the embroidery
of tarnished silver, seems a phantom risen,
an aroma, roses, rising from the hidden
couch, now void, the snuffed-out candle shrouds,
an aroma, over the sachet, of frozen golds,
a drift of flowers unfaithful to the moon
(though the taper’s quenched, petals still fall from one),
flowers whose long regrets and stems appear
drenched in a lonely vase to languish there…
an aurora dragged her wings in the basin’s tears! magical shadow with symbolic powers!
a voice from the distant past, an evocation,
is it not mine prepared for incantation?
in the yellow folds of thought, still unexhumed,
lingering, and like an antique cloth perfumed,
spread on a pile of monstrances grown cold,
through ancient hollows and through stiffened folds
pierced in the rhythm of the pure lace shroud
through which the old veiled brightness is allowed
to mount, in desperation, shall arise
(but oh, the distance hidden in those cries!)
the old veiled brightness of a strange gilt-silver,
of the languishing voice, estranged and unfamiliar:
will it scatter its gold in an ultimate splendor,
and, in the hour of its agony, render
itself as the anthem for psalms of petition?
for all are alike in being brought to perdition
by the power of old silence and deepening gloom,
fated, monotonous, vanquished, undone,
like the sluggish waters of an ancient pond. sometimes she sang an incoherent song.
lamentable sign!
the bed of vellum sheets,
useless and closed–not linen!—vainly waits,
bereft now of the cherished grammary
that spelled the figured folds of reverie,
the silken tent that harbored memory,
the fragrance of sleeping hair. were these its treasure?
cold child, she held within her subtle pleasure,
shivering with flowers in her walks at dawn,
or when the pomegranate’s flesh is torn
by wicked night! alone, the crescent moon
on the iron clockface is a pendulum
suspending lucifer: the clepsydra pours
dark drops in grief upon the stricken hours
as, wounded, each one wanders a dim shade
on undeciphered paths without a guide!
all this the king knows not, whose salary
has fed so long this agèd breast now dry.
her father knows it no more than the cruel
glacier mirroring his arms of steel,
when sprawled on a pile of corpses without coffins
smelling obscurely of resin, he deafens
with dark silver trumpets the ancient pines!
will he ever come back from the cisalpines?
soon enough! for all is bad dream and foreboding!
on the fingernail raised in the stained glass, according
to the memory of the trumpets, the old sky burns,
and to an envious candle it turns
a finger. and soon, when the sad sun sinks,
it shall pierce through the body of wax till it shrinks!
no sunset, but the red awakening
of the last day concluding everything
struggles so sadly that time disappears,
the redness of apocalypse, whose tears
fall on the child, exiled to her own proud
heart, as the swan makes its plumage a shroud
for its eyes, the old swan, and is carried away
from the plumage of grief to the eternal highway
of its hopes, where it looks on the diamonds divine
of a moribund star, which never more shall shine!

yesterday i found my pipe while pondering a long evening of work, of fine winter work. thrown aside were my cigarettes, with all the childish joys of summer, into the past which the leaves shining blue in the sun, the muslins, illuminate, and taken up once again was the grave pipe of a serious man who wants to smoke for a long while without being disturbed, so as better to work: but i was not prepared for the surprise that this abandoned object had in store for me; for hardly had i drawn the first puff when i forgot the grand books i was planning to write, and, amazed, moved to a feeling of tenderness, i breathed in the air of the previous winter which was now coming back to me. i had not been in contact with my faithful sweetheart since returning to france, and now all of london, london as i had lived it a year ago entirely alone, appeared before my eyes: first the dear fogs that muffle one’s brains and have an odor of their own there when they penetrate beneath the casements. my tobacco had the scent of a somber room with leather furniture sprinkled by coal dust, on which the thin black cat would curl and stretch; the big fires! and the maid with red arms pouring coals, and the noise of those coals falling from the sheet-iron bucket into the iron scuttle in the morning—when the postman gave the solemn double knock that kept me alive! once again i saw through the windows those sickly trees of the deserted square—i saw the open sea, crossed so often that winter, shivering on the deck of the steamer wet with drizzle and blackened from the fumes—with my poor wandering beloved, decked out in traveller’s clothes, a long dress, dull as the dust of the roads, a coat clinging damply to her cold shoulders, one of those straw hats with no feather and hardly any ribbons that wealthy ladies throw away upon arrival, mangled as they are by the sea, and that poor loved ones refurbish for many another season. around her neck was wound the terrible handkerchief that one waves when saying goodbye forever.

in the muddy maze of some old neighborhood, often, where the street lamp gleams like blood, as the wind whips the flame, rattles the glass, where human beings ferment in a stormy mass, one sees a ragpicker knocking against the walls, paying no heed to the spies of the cops, his thralls, but stumbling like a poet lost in dreams; he pours his heart out in stupendous schemes. he takes great oaths and dictates sublime laws, casts down the wicked, aids the victims' cause; beneath the sky, like a vast canopy, he is drunken of his splendid qualities. yes, these people, plagued by household cares, bruised by hard work, tormented by their years, each bent double by the junk he carries, the jumbled vomit of enormous paris,—they come back, perfumed with the smell of stale wine-barrels, followed by old comrades, pale from war, mustaches like limp flags, to march with banners, flowers, through the triumphal arch erected for them, by some magic touch! and in the dazzling, deafening debauch of bugles, sunlight, of huzzas and drum, bring glory to the love-drunk folks at home! even so, wine pours its gold to frivolous humanity, a shining pactolus; then through man's throat of high exploits it sings and by its gifts reigns like authentic kings.to lull these wretches' sloth and drown the hate of all who mutely die, compassionate, god has created sleep's oblivion; man added wine, divine child of the sun.

at my side the demon writhes forever, swimming around me like impalpable air; as i breathe, he burns my lungs like fever and fills me with an eternal guilty desire. knowing my love of art, he snares my senses, apearing in woman's most seductive forms, and, under the sneak's plausible pretenses, lips grow accustomed to his lewd love-charms. he leads me thus, far from the sight of god, panting and broken with fatigue into the wilderness of ennui, deserted and broad, and into my bewildered eyes he throws visions of festering wounds and filthy clothes, and all destruction's bloody retinue.

strung through the loops of our virtual displacement. but it isn’t wings or hooks or hooves or horns or see-through or white.
whether afloat in a boat or aloft in a plane. the way maps affect time.
for a second i think i feel the fleeting texture of your skin. lumbar & sacral nerves descend to exits beyond the end of the cord.
keep the blood in at all costs, even when the wind crackles its cells.
the coming of electricity, half next time & half this:
my five. my unending ache at the absence of you.

she wants a house full of cups and the ghosts
of last century’s lesbians; i want a spotless
apartment, a fast computer. she wants a woodstove,
three cords of ash, an axe; i want
a clean gas flame. she wants a row of jars:
oats, coriander, thick green oil;
i want nothing to store. she wants pomanders,
linens, baby quilts, scrapbooks. she wants wellesley
reunions. i want gleaming floorboards, the river’s
reflection. she wants shrimp and sweat and salt;
she wants chocolate. i want a raku bowl,
steam rising from rice. she wants goats,
chickens, children. feeding and weeping. i want
wind from the river freshening cleared rooms.
she wants birthdays, theaters, flags, peonies.
i want words like lasers. she wants a mother’s
tenderness. touch ancient as the river.
i want a woman’s wit swift as a fox.
she’s in her city, meeting
her deadline; i’m in my mill village out late
with the dog, listening to the pinging wind bells, thinking
of the twelve years of wanting, apart and together.
we’ve kissed all weekend; we want
to drive the hundred miles and try it again.

o venlo, venlo, stedje van pleseer. this time
her body made him think of countryside,
some figure from his childhood, sun on scythe,
wind blowing shadows across the shining barley, the milk-pail dented from use, the smell of leaf-mulch
and leather in the tack room. soon she’d take bus
and ferry from london to belfast, but first
the fire in her bed-sit. her fingers traveled too, down the raised purple scars along his vertebrae,
the flannel sheets between her thighs, his hair
trailing along her abdomen, the quill
of a feather poking through seams of the comforter, the comforter itself. those scars—he’d lied
to her, his time in nicaragua, thugs cut
him coming from the fields. the bloodier fight
was with his brother, slicing tines of a pitchfork plucked up along the flooded maas. everything
reduced to trinket and anecdote, the beer
and facepaint of carnival, street-dance and tuba,
beyond the muddy english roundabouts, the brown and white waves, yellow lamps along dutch highways,
his work at the union office pinned beneath
a glass globe paperweight—shaken
it showered silver snow over the widestraw hat, red and green plow, the slouching body,
a campesino from days before somoza fell.
he wondered if she were any better, smuggling
french social theory into ulster, encounter groups in the rec-centers of tower-block basements.
she’d just gotten the news: her last lover died
in a fire along the side of the highway, body
broken in seven places, silver chrome, pearl and gold gas tank scorched, his bike crumpled
beneath the husk of an overturned van.
there wasn’t much to talk about. afterwards she lay
with her back to him and he sang her carnival songs in a language she didn’t speak, o venlo, stedje vanpleseer. he thought of himself as the sun, kissing
her neck at the hairline, turning grey cobblestones
of the town-square silver, marshaling parades.

forget contingencies from weather and wind,
my helen’s head was shaved, the shortest bit
of stubble growing in. with darkened arching
black eye-brows, betty-blue mouth penciled red, jet patent-leather trench and high-heeled boots,
she seemed more mannequin for fashion ave.’s
penitent spread than enemy to brass
at camp lejeune. simply and grudgingly put, her talk was action. invincible in bell-
atlantic block and tack, she converted non-coms
and saved co’s, harped flint and skinned the chair
of military courts through well-pitched cheek, prompt dispatch from the war resister’s league.
she looked good even on a bicycle, hemming left
through traffic on fourteenth street, locking up
on lafayette or grand. she doused for me to celebrate—marched right through human waste
and bowery puddles, stretched her legs over the last
old-fashioned hobos up to east second street.
those ancient days, our vestibule was manned by crack-dealing stan, a concierge of wit
and improv, half his face scored by orange scars
from hydrofluoric burns. he kept the place safe.
but i had gone, cleared out behind a gang of kids from bronxville high on catnip wins,
shell-game victims. left stan my toaster, shelves,
a wire bird-cage, and, for once, nothing to say.
except to ask if he could touch her skull.
even now it makes no sense. her precedents
i knew lurched out of focus: photos from france
after the vichy fell, jeannes and sylvianes
who’d made nazi moll; those belfast girlslast-ditched by soldier boys or peelers; two-
toned bergen-belsen, bald sister to fort santiago.
then squeaky fromm, the other manson moms,
at charlie’s trial. extremes of joan of arc,or even buddhist nuns. hated, chastened—
or chaste, at least. not what you’d run (i ran)
your fingers satisfied across, the stubble
surprising, soft as mink or fox, and arch your back, as i did once she found me uptown,
say yes i give again when she went down—
and faster now, quick as the television
dropped after dishes to the curb—or slipped gradually up, the seconds separating
as slowly as but more exquisitely than
ticks off expensive fifty-minute hours—
and some community service—all gone, and just as easily forgotten the raft of former friends
i’d cursed and floated off the island. shaved head,
her slender neck, dark shoulders—that was half—
or less—her most convincing argument.

country people rise early as their distant lights testify. they don’t hold water in common. each house has a personal source, like a bank account, a stone vault. some share eggs, some share expertise, and some won’t even wave. a walk for the mail elevates the heart rate. last november i saw a woman down the road walk out to her mailbox dressed in blaze orange cap to boot, a cautious soul. bullets can’t read her no trespassing sign. strange to think they’re in the air like lead bees with a fatal sting. our neighbor across the road sits in his kitchen with his rifle handy and the window open. you never know when. once he shot a trophy with his barrel resting on the sill. he’s in his seventies, born here, joined the navy, came back. hard work never hurt a man until suddenly he was another broken tool. his silhouette against the dawn droops as though drought-stricken, each step deliberate, down the driveway to his black mailbox, prying it open. checking a trap.

some are born to sweet delight. some are born to endless night.
—william blake, “auguries of innocence” we spend our lives trying to grasp the premise. william blake is not, for instance,
william blake, but rather a 19th century accountant from cleveland on the
lam for murder & the theft of a horse. in the closing scene, he is going to die, & so is nobody, his half-blackfoot, half-blood guide.
sure, this is a western, a morality tale
about a destiny made manifest
through the voice of a gun & a hero whose mythic flight from innocence destroys him. but we all come to the end of the line soon enough.
the obvious just seems wiser
when nobody says it. time, it turns out,
is the most common noun in the english language, as if by constant invocation, we could keep it at bay.
yesterday, i sat in another state on a large rubber ball
in my brother’s basement bouncing my newborn nephew in my arms.
his mother, on the phone with a friend, asks what we should fear more, the hobo spider or the poison that kills it. i want to whisper into his ear
something that feels like knowledge: once upon a time, there was nothing& one day, there will be nothing again. this is the faraway place to which his tiny weight calls me. if he could understand the words. i think,
he would know what i mean, having only just sprung himself
from that fine sea.
sometimes we coo to soothe him: don’t cry, little bird. i know, i know. but only the roar of the vacuum finally calms him,
for nothing sounds as much
like the lost world of the womb as the motors of our machines.
the root of travel means torture, having passed from medieval latin into old french. as the action opens, johnny depp, shot in black & white,
is already rocking into night on a train. and soon, he will begin his dying.
this is not to say that the inky band fanning across the morning blue of a kestrel’s tail feathers
has no meaning, or the first fingers of rust
coming into bloom on the green enameled chassis of a corona typewriter
left in the rain.
direct observation, the naturalist niko tinbergen assures us,
is the only real thing. perhaps this is what i should tell him.
or that this moment,
too, is a part of some migration. every snow bunting composes its own song,
& a careful watcher can tell one kittiwake from its neighbor by the little dots on the tips of its wings.
the most used verb is also the most humble—
merely to be.
nobody can teach to william blake the auguries of william blake.
we are, instead, our own vatic visions, bumbling prophets. our sense of ourselves
as invented as film.
later, in an ocean-going canoe lined with cedar boughs,
he will drift out into cold breakers, two bullets in his chest. but, here,
in his small hat & wire glasses, he still seems
sweetly comic. he holds up a letter; someone’s promised him a job. his fancy plaid suit makes him look like a clown.

what objects may be in themselves, and apart from all this receptivity of our sensibility, remains completely unknown to us. we know nothing but our mode of perceiving them. . . . with this alone have weany concern.—immanuel kant, critique of pure reason at a church rummage sale, i study the perfection of shadows
in a painting by caravaggio, although what i hold
is only a small print of christ—its frame broken—dining
at emmaus with three of the apostles. and because the table
is dramatically, if not unbelievably, lit, the bowls & pitcher
& loaves send their dark crescents onto the immaculate
white cloth. when the savior raises his hand to offer a blessing,
its shade deepens further his crimson smock. tenebrosus:
that rich, convincing darkness. as though the master understood
that the obscured world only seems to us somehow
even more familiar, as though our sense of our own unknowing
had at last been made visible—even if what we do not know
cannot itself be seen. the future’s drape, the carnival fortunetellers
of my childhood might have called it, but also the now’s,
displayed as it is—so many unmatched cups & saucers, old coats
& wicker baskets—all around us. at a party last week,
someone said verisimilitude. we were huddled on a tiny porch.
it was the first cool night & the wine had no conclusion. the talk turned quickly to shepherds & the pastoral & then,
to opera, before someone recalled a horror film he’d watched
late one night with his brother. in black & white vignettes,
an evil tree stump possessed by the spirit of an executed prince
hunts the scheming tribal elders who have destroyed him.
a former pro wrestler in a costume of wire & rubber bark
& wearing a permanent scowl lumbers after vengeance
in the confusion & fear of 1957 on a half-dozen root-legs,
driving his victims into quicksand or toppling himself over
upon him. though here the point is the teller’s small brother
& the boy’s allegiance, even in a state of suspended disbelief,
to what we call sense. how, he wanted to know, suddenly
unusually earnest, did the tree manage to get itself up again? yesterday i spoke to a friend who is despairing: back home,
waiting tables, he’s dating a woman whose marriage has only
just come to an end. when he wakes, he discovers he does not
recognize himself. one afternoon, walking home from school,
i hit my best friend in the face with a book. it may well be
that she hit me. thin pages flew out into the street. more punches
were thrown & i came away bruised. in that book, a novel
by emily brontë, the land is violent & unjust & we are violent
& unjust upon it. even worse, our greatest passions
change nothing at all. before one of us hit the other,
there must have been a cause, but i can’t recall it, which makes it
seem nonlinear now, &, thus, apocryphal, both impossible
& impossibly real. i failed, though i tried, to offer comfort. it’s not that our lives don’t resemble our lives. i’ve been alone
so often lately i sometimes catch myself watching myself—
breathing in the fresh spears of rosemary or admiring the shallots,
peeling their translucent wrappers away, centering one on the board,
making the first careful cut, lifting the purple halves. before stories, we were too busy for stories, too busy
hunting & suffering to invent the tales of our own
resurrections. caught out in the kitchen’s brightness last night,
the handle of the skillet cast its simple, perfected form
across the stove—pierced, like the eye of the needle, so that
it can be hung from a hook, as pans, presumably, have always been. outside the wind picked up. thunder. the dog trotted off,
hid her head beneath the chair. but today: a charity sale
at trinity chapel & sun on the tar of the buckled walks.
in the cracks, beads of water spin into light. tell yourself
it’s simple: this is where it’s been heading all along. tell yourself
something you have no faith in has already begun to occur.

—marcus aurelius when we are lost in our longings, aurelius, already it is too late:
there is already nothing we can do. i have rarely desired an end
to my desires. we are so in love with our wanting. last week,
though doctors were quick to repair it, a baby in india was born
grasping her own beating heart in her fist. today, a dumpster
arrives from dave’s trash removal & i begin to fill it. i toss in
a transistor radio that hasn’t worked in years. a man walking past
asks if he can take it. later, he returns & carries off a broken tv.
a neighbor salvages the dented gray fuse box; a girl wants a window,
a paper bag full of tangled cords. all night i listen to the wind
& the echoes of feet kicking through rubbish, like a mouse nesting
inside a drum. my older brother is dead a decade. yet here
in its enormous gold frame is the familiar, pastel portrait
someone named maxwell drew for our mother, an inaccurate
rendering of the two of us when we were small. i can’t look at it;
i can’t throw it away. every change is a death, you tell yourself, turn thy thoughts now to thy life as a child. . . . one day, i tell myself,
i will shut all the doors, leave everything behind. the museum
is showing a hundred tricked-out victorian photographs
of that other world: the hoax of floating fairies, women haunted
by ghostly blurs. another century & still we want to believe
in what we know cannot be true. your words, aurelius, have found me,
but you could not. if we are disappointed, we have only ourselves
to blame: wipe out thy imagination. we fill our hands when they are
empty. we empty ourselves when we have held too much too long.

i am trying to remember the lyrics of old songs
i’ve forgotten, mostly
i am trying to remember one-hit wonders, hymns,
and musicals like west side story.
singing over and over what i can recall, i hum remnants on
buses and in the car.i am so often alone these days with echoes of these old songs
and my ghosted lovers.
i am so often alone that i can almost hear it, can almost feel
the half-touch of others,
can almost taste the licked clean spine of the melody i’ve lost. i remember the records rubbed with static and the needle
gathering dust.
i remember the taste of a mouth so sudden and still cold from
wintry gusts.
it seemed incredible then — a favorite song, a love found.
it wasn't, after all. days later, while vacuuming, the lyrics come without thinking.
days later, i think i see my old lover in a café but don’t,
how pleasing
it was to think it was him, to finally sing that song. this is the way of all amplitude: we need the brightness
to die some.
this is the way of love and music: it plays like a god and
then is done.
do i feel better remembering, knowing for certain
what’s gone?

i like it when they get together and talk in voices that sound like apple trees and grape vines, and some of them wear hats and go to arizona in the winter, and they all like to play cards. they will always be the ones who say “it is time to go now,” even as we linger at the door, or stand by the waiting cars, they remember someone—an uncle we never knew—and sigh, all of them together, like wind in the oak trees behind the farm where they grew up—a place i remember—especially the hen house and the soft clucking that filled the sunlit yard.

the marriage ran under their skin, a rash, or maybe
all that red wine, luminescent cocktail hours
in which lost books were rediscovered, or just a rash,
a reaction sending out runners across her chest,
a vine, something close, ruby scarves coming back
into fashion, their son coming back
from school, from the yard, but now, dinnertime
and the family parted, split houses, her ex and his anger
spread down the long hallway of their house
and into the windows of her new apartment, their daughter’s doubled
beds, her doubled face in family portraits that double
in frequency, a family set down and another, this dinnertime
and more red wine, our faces flush with love and sympathy,
the mother decides to see the son again, and so
our doubled flashlights giving us heaven and earth,
all of it safe or at least unmoving, the tall fence
her ex built to hide the little grave, to guard the lot
in this registered historic district (all of the houses
bear their stories on a plaque, their first stories,
run-on, this little town with no street lights, just moon,
cedars), the tall fence behind which is the yard, blue,
in this yard no marker stone and under this stone
their son’s everything, no double,

the soil around them will bleed with rust. in this land children
study their magazines in broad daylight, and in their books
any soldier who stumbles will not fall. no one will fall,
a gift parents try not to make much of. at every meal
some is set aside. in every garden a patch lies fallow. at parties
there are whispers of illegal cheeses. camembert, especially,
is said to taste alive. and so the children learn
to make room. to leave some.
nothing will come, but nothing will go.
to love like this half must rattle in its pit.

they learned to turn off the gravity in an auditorium

pow-wows and prestidigitation. but not everyone believed it.
that was the most important lesson
i learned—that a truck driven by a dog
could roll down a hill at dusk
and roll right off a dock into a lake
and sink, and if no one believes you
then what is the point
of telling them wonderful things? i walked home from the pow-wow

the germans are so persnickety and precise,
they wash their driveways. their mountains and streams
dance around each other in a clockwork, courtly imitation
of spring. they build the panzer tank, out of rakes
hoses and garden gnomes; they built me.
and i’ve seated myself above an avenue on the brink
of mystery, always just on the lip, with my toes over the lip
but my bowels behind. when i replaced the ink the sky was socked in,
only one window of blue open in the north, directly over someone.
but that person was reading about rosicrucians in the laundromat,
he was unaware as the blue window closed above him.
the rest of us are limp and damp,
i see a button in front of us that says “spin cycle.”

a warm, valerian smell cascades

heat sits impishly on my chest,

panic creeps out of my armpits.
i can only move my eyelids and toes,
and this constant fluttering
lulls me to sleep. i awake late and move like a bee
through the apartment,
from station to station
from the blue flame
to the shimmering disc.
from the stairs to the street,
to the grocery store.
to the meat aisle. to the cocktail wieners.
to make pigs-in-a-blanket,
to share them with friends.
to sink into bed, to bind myself
tightly in blankets, to flutter off into sleep,
and then on past sleep,
to be carried by admirers across a wooden bridge.

the louvre: a couple necking in an alcove, in their brief bodies entwined near the super-radiance hall visible as speech.
speech: the bird that bursts from the mouth shall not return.
pop song: we got your pretty girls they’re talking on mobile phones la la la.
enguerrand quarton: in your dream gold leaf was the sun, salve on the kingdom of the visible.
gold leaf: the mind makes itself a midas, it cannot hold and not have.
thus: i came to the city of possession.
sleeping: behind the clock, in the diagon, in your endless summer night, in the city remaking itself like a wave in which people live or are said to live, it comes down to the same thing, an exaggerated sense of things getting done.
paris: the train station’s a museum, opera in the place of the prison.

now the summer air exerts its syrupy drag on the half-dark
city under the strict surveillance of quotation marks. the citizens with their cockades and free will drift off
from the magnet of work to the terrible magnet of love.in the far suburbs crenellated of cartesian yards and gin
the tribe of mothers calls the tribe of children in across the bluing evening. it’s the hour things get
to be excellently pointless, like describing the alphabet. yikes. it’s fine to be here with you watching the great events
without taking part, clinking our ice as they advance yet remain distant. like the baker always about to understand
idly sweeping up that he is the recurrence of napoleon in a baker’s life, always interrupted by the familiar notes
of a childish song, “no more sleepy dreaming,” we float casually on the surface of the day, staring at the bottom,
jotting in our daybooks, how beautiful, the armies of autumn.

our grand peregrinations through these temporary cities,
these pale window box poppies of the laughing class,
drifting as if time came in the same long dollops as starlight,
resemble an epic journey as a coffee bean resembles a llama’s foot,
though the kitchen table may be far from the desert
it’s near in spirit, a yellow oasis before the wind
starts its restless sweeping of white flower-dust across the lintel,
marking the fine edge of things like children asleep
at the opera, piled up near the door, summer passing
on its way out. prince valiant vowed to sew the horizons
into a single idea, to put on the blue dress of distance,
looping past rivers and mountains as one leaps from bed
to bed to make loneliness lonely, the suburbs were for him
a relief, a pageant of calm desire where he settled,
all the king’s horses grazing on forsythia out back
while the evening tilts back out of the night, a kindly drunk
uncle, and asks you to stay. was this the end of traveling?
or just a change in the story over time, as for example howtous les chevaux du roi become josie and the pussycats
from one version to the next? so all heroes are deranged
by something quite common yet unexpected, a constellation
redrawn and named again through the stars
above the porch don’t shift but seem to sink
through winter’s pitcher of noircotic ink,
leaving a single streetlight that burned happily,
thinking it was the sun, after all it was the day
of the night and turned the world around it,
we were good sentences and forgot where we started.

this is a big help because otherwise it was getting pretty enigmatic.
welcome to the desert of the real,
i am an ephemeral and not too discontented citizen.
i do not think the revolution is finished.
so during these years, i lived in a country where i was little known,
with the thunder of the gods that protect the icelandic tundra from advertising,
great red gods, great yellow gods, great green gods, planted at the edges of the speculative tracks along which the mind speeds from one feeling to another, from one idea to its consequence
past the proud apartment houses, fat as a fat money bag. i wish that i might stay in this pleasant, conventional city,
a placid form, a modest form, but one with a claim to pleasure,
and then vanish in the fogs of hypnolondon.
all are in their proper place in these optical whispering-galleries,
the swan-winged horses of the skies with summer’s music in their manes,
the basic los angeles dingbat,
a housewife in any neighborhood in any city in any part of mexico on a saturday night.
every sunday is too little sunday,
a living grave, the true grave of the head.
in one shout desire rises and dies.
composed while i was asleep on horseback
i drift, mainly i drift.

he faced the sink, one foot up
on the edge of the tub. she stood
behind him, reaching around.
in the mirror, her face rose
over his shoulder like the moon,
and like the moon she regarded him
beautifully but without feeling,
and he looked at her as he would
at the moon: how beautiful! how distant! no smiling, no weeping,
no talking. a man and a woman
transacting their magnificent business
with the usual equanimity. the man
as a passenger walking the ship’s deck
at evening and the woman as the moon
over his shoulder oiling the ocean
with light. deep in the ship’s belly
pistons churned and sailors fed
the boilers' roar with coal. on deck
just the engine’s dull thrum and
a faint click as the woman sets her ring
on the cool white lip of the sink.

he slaughtered a six of miller in thanks
when his supposed schizophrenia turned
out to be mere panic, fewer than half
the syllables and “easily managed with
the new medications.” chanted that mantra
when his piano teacher’s voice droned on
like an undertow beneath chopin hours
after she herself had gone home to queens
and when stop signs seemed to say slightly more
than stop, seemed in fact to convey highly
specific messages to him and him alone
suggesting he assume certain key
responsibilities including twenty-four-hour
telephone contact with his finacée
“to make sure nothing bad happens to her”
and the immediate emergency
closure of the holland tunnel…oh, come

and after all it took so long to nose
the rental car’s savage servility
through new jersey for thanksgiving at her

can’t possibly have been the same person
he had been when he left brooklyn and is
that not a kind of multiple person-
ality? it took hours. and then it was
awkward. which could describe so many things.
the gangly half-dismantled turkey splayed
on its platter. her stepfather's lecture
on property taxes and tougher sentences.
the seven-dollar jug of chablis which
would come up later while he held back her hair.
every good boy deserves fudge and he tried
to be one and earn huge loamy slabs of it.
he practiced his scales on the steering wheel
as he breezed by stop sign after stop sign
toward the tunnel, stopped to search for the
exact change, then resumed rehearsal as
she, deeply soused, snored wetly beside him
smelling like something spilled on a rug. he
keyed each étude over and over as though
there would not be many more chances or

thankful. but what am i doing in here.

photograph found in the road: bejeweled hand
gripping a limp dick. all parties
suffering from lack of ambition. the hills
of tuscany won’t dapple with sunlight,
and here it is nearly noon. she didn’t
much want the leather jacket, the vendor didn’t
really care to sell it, she hardly tried

everyone wasn’t hungry and went to lunch.
the rubies won’t glow. the delayed train shrugs
on its siding. the penis appears at ease. osteria, osteria, osteria, osteria.

love is never strong enough to find the words befitting it.
camusall day my husband pounds on the upstairs porch.
screeches and grunts of wood as the wall is opened
keep the whole house tormented. he is trying to reach
the bees, he is after bees. this is the climax, an end
to two summers of small operations with sprays and ladders.
last june on the porch floor i found them dead,
a sprinkle of dusty bugs, and next day a still worse
death, until, like falling in love, bee-haunted,
i swept up bigger and bigger loads of some hatch,
i thought, sickened, and sickening me, from what origin?
my life centered on bees, all floors were suspect. the search
was hopeless. windows were shut. i never find
where anything comes from. but in june my husband’s fierce
sallies began, inspections, cracks located
and sealed, insecticides shot; outside, the bees’ coursewatched, charted; books on bees read.
i tell you i swept up bodies every day on the porch.
then they’d stop, the problem was solved; then they were there again,
as the feelings make themselves known again, as they beseech
sleepers who live innocently in will and mind.it is no surprise to those who walk with their tigers
that the bees were back, no surprise to me. but they had
left themselves so lack-luster, their black and gold furs
so deathly faded. gray bugs that the broom hunted
were like a thousand little stops when some great lurch of heart takes place, or a great shift of season.
november it came to an end. no bees. and i could watch
the floor, clean and cool, and, from windows, the cold land.
but this spring the thing began again, and his curse
went upstairs again, and his tinkering and reasoning and pride.it is the man who takes hold. i lived from bees, but his force
went out after bees and found them in the wall where they hid.
and now in july he is tearing out the wall, and each
board ripped brings them closer to his hunting hand.
it is quiet, has been quiet for a while. he calls me, and i march from a dream of bees to see them, winged and unwinged,
such a mess of interrupted life dumped on newspapers—
dirty clots of grubs, sawdust, stuck fliers, all smeared
together with old honey, they writhe, some of them, but who cares?
they go to the garbage, it is over, everything has been said. but there is more. wouldn’t you think the bees had suffered
enough? this evening we go to a party, the breeze
dies, late, we are sticky in our old friendships and light-headed.
we tell our funny story about the bees.
at two in the morning we come home, and a friend, a scientist, comes with us, in his car. we’re going to save
the idea of the thing, a hundred bees, if we can find
so many unrotted, still warm but harmless, and leave
the rest. we hope that the neighbors are safe in bed,
taking no note of these private catastrophes. he wants an enzyme in the flight-wing muscle. not a bad
thing to look into. in the night we rattle and raise
the lid of the garbage can. flashlights in hand,
we open newspapers, and the men reach in a salve
of happenings. i can’t touch it. i hate the self-examined who’ve killed the self. the dead are darker, but the others have
moved in the ooze toward the next moment. my god
one half-worm gets its wings right before our eyes.
searching fingers sort and lay bare, they need
the idea of bees—and yet, under their touch, the craze for life gets stronger in the squirming, whitish kind.
the men do it. making a claim on the future, as love
makes a claim on the future, grasping. and i, underhand,
i feel it start, a terrible, lifelong heave
taking direction. unpleading, the men prod till all that grubby softness wants to give, to give.

"the younger brother roasted a breast of pishiboro's
elephant wife and handed pishiboro some, which he
presently ate. then the younger brother said in a
voice full of scorn. 'oh you fool. you lazy man. you
were married to meat and you thought it was a
wife.'"
from a myth of the bushmen poised upside down on its duncecap,
a shrunken purple head,
true blueberry,
enters its tightening frame of orange lip,
and the cream of a child’s cheek is daubed with
zanzibar cocoa, while here at the martha Washington ice cream store we outdo the symbolistes.
a fine green trickle—
pistachio? mint julep? words have colors, and colors are tasty.
sweetens his chin.
in front of me licorice teeters like a lump of coal
on its pinkish base of pumpkin. a rauschenberg tongue fondles this rich donnée, then begins to erase it. turning from all that is present
in the flesh, so to speak,
let the eye wander off to a menu,
where it can start to ingest
“quite sour lemon sherbet
topped with a stem cherry and chocolate sprinkles
swilling in language,
all floating in bubbly cherry phosphate
the bloated imagination is urged to open still wider
and shovel it in,
and served with a twist of pretzel.”
in this world “creamy vanilla and
smooth swiss chocolate ice creams”
can be “blended with chopped pineapple,
dark fudge sauce, ripe bananas, whipped topping,
cookies, roasted nutmeats and nippy chopped cherries.”
the unconscious, that old hog,
being in charge here of the
creative act.at about the moment my tastebuds
receive a last tickle of gingersnap
and begin to respond to
orange fudge, i look at you
who have bought my ice cream cones for twenty years,
moving another new ice to the mouth
we needn’t remember
and look away
it is always the same mouth
that melts it.
my mind assembles a ribald tower
of sherbet dips, all on one cone,
apricot, apple, tangerine, peach, prune, lime,
and then it topples.
you are steadier than i.
you order one dip always,
or, in a dish, two dips of the same flavor.in this hysterical brilliance of neon
come on, consumers,
we’ve got to keep scooping
it is twelve or fifteen of us
to thirty ice creams.
so that the creams shall not rise
like cold lava out of their bins,
numbing our feet, our knees,
freezing our chests, our chins, our eyes,
open the door, quick,
and let in two handholding adolescents.
coping with all those glands
makes them good and hungry.
so that, flying out of their cannisters,
the chopped nuts
shall not top off our technicolor grave
with their oily ashes. listen! all around us toothsome cones
are suffering demolition
down to the last, nipple-like tip.
how do we know where to stop?
perhaps the glasses and dishes
are moulded of candy, and the counters and windows…over your half-eaten serving of italian delight, why are you looking at me the way you are looking at me?

i was out last night,
the very picture of a sneak, dark and hunched-over,
breaking and entering again.
why do i do it?
and why, when i can afford serious residences,
do i keep to this one room?
perhaps if i had not lost track of the difference
between the real and the ideal
it would never have happened.
i hide here almost entirely now.
when i go out, when i creep into those silent houses,
i steal newspapers.
an armload, no more than i can carry comfortably.
sometimes they are already tied up
on the side porch or by the kitchen stove.
nobody misses them.
they think each other or the maid
has carried them out to the street.
they say there is something intractable out there,
the law, the right to privacy,
the world.
in the days when my obsession was only a wound-up toy,
squeaking and jabbering in my chest,
i could have believed them.
i sit by the window today
(there is very little space left now,
thought i have left corridors wide enough to walk through
so i won't lose touch)
holding my latest on my lap,
handling them, fondling them, taking in every column.
they are becoming more and more precious.
my delusion grows and spreads.
lately it seems to me
as i read of murders, wars, bankruptcies, jackpot winnings,
the news if written in that perfect style
of someone speaking to the one
who knows and loves him.
long before they miss me, i think,
the room will be perfectly solid.
when they break in the door and, unsurprised,
hardened to the most bizarre vagaries,
begin to carry out my treasure,
death's what they'll look for underneath it all,
those fluent, muscled, imaginative men,
sweating in their innocent coveralls.
but i will be out in broad daylight by then,
answering,
having accepted utterly the heart's conditions.
tell them i wish them well, always,
that i've been happy.

uniformly over the whole countryside
the warm air flows imperceptibly seaward;
the autumn haze drifts in deep bands
over the pale water;
white egrets stand in the blue marshes;
tamalpais, diablo, st. helena
float in the air.
climbing on the cliffs of hunter’s hill
we look out over fifty miles of sinuous
interpenetration of mountains and sea. leading up a twisted chimney,
just as my eyes rise to the level
of a small cave, two white owls
fly out, silent, close to my face.
they hover, confused in the sunlight,
and disappear into the recesses of the cliff. all day i have been watching a new climber,
a young girl with ash blonde hair
and gentle confident eyes.
she climbs slowly, precisely,
with unwasted grace. while i am coiling the ropes,
watching the spectacular sunset,
she turns to me and says, quietly,
“it must be very beautiful, the sunset,
on saturn, with the rings and all the moons.”

in the years to come they will say,
“they fell like the leaves
in the autumn of nineteen thirty-nine.”
november has come to the forest,
to the meadows where we picked the cyclamen.
the year fades with the white frost
on the brown sedge in the hazy meadows,
where the deer tracks were black in the morning.
ice forms in the shadows;
disheveled maples hang over the water;
deep gold sunlight glistens on the shrunken stream.
somnolent trout move through pillars of brown and gold.
the yellow maple leaves eddy above them,
the glittering leaves of the cottonwood,
the olive, velvety alder leaves,
the scarlet dogwood leaves,
most poignant of all.in the afternoon thin blades of cloud
move over the mountains;
the storm clouds follow them;
fine rain falls without wind.
the forest is filled with wet resonant silence.
when the rain pauses the clouds
cling to the cliffs and the waterfalls.
in the evening the wind changes;
snow falls in the sunset.
we stand in the snowy twilight
and watch the moon rise in a breach of cloud.
between the black pines lie narrow bands of moonlight,
glimmering with floating snow.
an owl cries in the sifting darkness.
the moon has a sheen like a glacier.

died june 1916under your illkempt yellow roses,
delia, today you are younger
than your son. two and a half decades –
the family monument sagged askew,
and he overtook your half-a-life.
on the other side of the country,
near the willows by the slow river,
deep in the earth, the white ribs retain
the curve of your fervent, careful breast;
the fine skull, the ardor of your brain.
and in the fingers the memory
of chopin études, and in the feet
slow waltzes and champagne twosteps sleep.
and the white full moon of midsummer,
that you watched awake all that last night,
watches history fill the deserts
and oceans with corpses once again;
and looks in the east window at me,
as i move past you to middle age
and knowledge past your agony and waste.

it is the dark of the moon.
late at night, the end of summer,
the autumn constellations
glow in the arid heaven.
the air smells of cattle, hay,
and dust. in the old orchard
the pears are ripe. the trees
have sprouted from old rootstocks
and the fruit is inedible.
as i pass them i hear something
rustling and grunting and turn
my light into the branches.
two raccoons with acrid pear
juice and saliva drooling
from their mouths stare back at me,
their eyes deep sponges of light.
they know me and do not run
away. coming up the road
through the black oak shadows, i
see ahead of me, glinting
everywhere from the dusty
gravel, tiny points of cold
blue light, like the sparkle of
iron snow. i suspect what it is,
and kneel to see. under each
pebble and oak leaf is a
spider, her eyes shining at
me with my reflected light
across immeasurable distance.

the children are back, the children are back— they’ve come to take refuge, exhale and unpack; the marriage has faltered, the job has gone bad, come open the door for them, mother and dad. the city apartment is leaky and cold, the landlord lascivious, greedy and old— the mattress is lumpy, the oven’s encrusted, the freezer, the fan, and the toilet have rusted. the company caved, the boss went broke, the job and the love affair, all up in smoke. the anguish of loneliness comes as a shock— o heart in the doldrums, o heart in hock. and so they return with their piles of possessions, their terrified cats and their mournful expressions, reclaiming the bedrooms they had in their teens, clean towels, warm comforter, glass figurines. downstairs in the kitchen the father and mother don’t say a word, but they look at each other as down from the hill comes jill, comes jack. the children are back. the children are back.

the ill, so wistful in their rooms, so true.
my friend, the one who’s dying, took me out
to where the patients go to smoke, iv’s
and oxygen in tanks attached to them—
a tiny patio for skeletons. we shared
a cigarette, which was delicious but
too brief. i held his hand; it felt
like someone’s keys. how beautiful it was,
the sunlight pointing down at us, as if
we were important, full of life, unbound.
i wandered for a moment where his ribs
had made a space for me, and there, beside
the thundering waterfall of his heart,
i rubbed my eyes and thought, “i’m lost.”

to cure myself of wanting cuban songs,
i wrote a cuban song about the need
for people to suppress their fantasies,
especially unhealthy ones. the song
began by making reference to the sea,
because the sea is like a need so great
and deep it never can be swallowed. then
the song explores some common myths
about the cuban people and their folklore:
the story of a little carib boy
mistakenly abandoned to the sea;
the legend of a bird who wanted song
so desperately he gave up flight; a queen
whose strength was greater than a rival king’s.
the song goes on about morality,
and then there is a line about the sea,
how deep it is, how many creatures need
its nourishment, how beautiful it is
to need. the song is ending now, because
i cannot bear to hear it any longer.
i call this song of needful love my voice.

by menopause, it’s not just estrogen
my mother lacks. she’s lost her eldest son—
that’s me, the one who’s queer—the doctor who
once made her very proud. these days, i do
my own wash when i’m home, i cook for her
so she can take a break from all the chores
she now refuses to assign to me.
she sits, half-watching ricki through her tea’s
thin steam, her squint of disapproval more
denial than it is disgust. she hears
much better than she sees—it’s easier
to keep out vision than it is to clear
the air of sounds—and yet i know it’s age
that stultifies her senses too. enraged
because she’s lost so much, i understand
why suddenly she looks so stunned
as from the television: “. . . bitch, she stole
my boyfriend, my own mother did! . . .” i fold
a towel noiselessly. i know she thinks
it’s garbage, sinful, crap—just as she thinks
that taking estrogen in pills is not
what god intended, no matter what
the doctors say; or that i’m gay is plain
unnatural, she can’t endure such pain.
the oven timer rings. the cookies that
i’ve baked are done. i’ll make another batch
though she won’t touch them: given up for lent.
my mother’s love. i wonder where it went.

"the abdominal exam", by rafael campo [living, health & illness, the body]
before the glimmer of his sunken eyes,
what question could i answer with my lies? digesting everything, it’s all so plain
in him, his abdomen so thin the pain is almost visible. i probe the lump
his boyfriend noticed first, my left hand limp beneath the pressure of the right. with aids
you have to think lymphoma—swollen nodes, a tender spleen, the liver’s jutting edge—
it strikes me suddenly i will oblige this hunger that announces death is near,
and as i touch him, cold and cavalier, the language of beneath the diaphragm
has told me where it’s coming from and where i’m going, too: soft skin to rocks,
the body reveling until it wrecks against the same internal, hidden shoal,
the treasures we can’t hide, our swallowed gold.

how difficult it is to say goodbye
to scourge. for years we were obsessed with you,
your complex glycoproteins and your sly,
haphazard reproduction, your restraint
in your resistance, how you bathed so slight
yet fierce in our most intimate secretions.
we will remember you for generations;
electron micrographs of you seem quaint
already, in the moment of our victory.
how difficult it is to claim one’s right
to living honestly. the honesty
you taught was nothing quite as true as death, but neither was it final. yes,
we vanquished you, with latex, protease
inhibitors, a little common sense—
what’s that, you say? that some remain at risk?
how dare you try to threaten us again!
of course, you’d like to make outrageous claims
that some behaviors haven’t changed, that some
have not had access to the drugs that mask
your presence in the body. difficult
it is, how very sad, to see you strain
(no pun intended) at response—our quilts,
our bravest poetry, our deaths with grace and dignity have put you in your place.
this elegy itself renounces you,
as from this consciousness you’ve been erased.
the love for you was very strong, the hot
pursuits so many of us reveled in—
but what once felt like love was really not.
i hardly know what i will find to hate
as much as i have loved and hated what
you brought to bear upon my verse, the weight
of your oppression and the joys of truth.
how difficult it is—to face the white
of nothingness, of clarity. we win!

what i would like to give them for a change
is not the usual prescription with
its hubris of the power to restore,
to cure; what i would like to give them, ill
from not enough of laying in the sun
not caring what the onlookers might think
while feeding some banana to their dogs—
what i would like to offer them is this,
not reassurance that their lungs sound fine,
or that the mole they’ve noticed change is not
a melanoma, but instead of fear
transfigured by some doctorly advice
i’d like to give them my astonishment
at sudden rainfall like the whole world weeping,
and how ridiculously gently it
slicked down my hair; i’d like to give them that,
the joy i felt while staring in your eyes
as you learned epidemiology
(the science of disease in populations),
the night around our bed like timelessness,
like comfort, like what i would give to them.

blood we wondered if the rumors got to her.
i’d seen her with that other girl behind
the stop and shop when i was walking home
from school one day. i swear, the two of them
were kissing, plain as that, the grass so high
it brushed their cheeks. i told my teacher so,
and maybe it was her who called their folks.
before too long, it was like everyone
in town had heard. we waited for them at
the dime store once, where cedric grabbed her tits
and said i’ll learn you how to love how god intended it, you ugly fucking dyke.
thing was, she wasn’t ugly like you’d think.
she had a certain quality, a shyness
maybe, and i’d describe the way she laughed
as kind of gentle. anyway, we never saw her with
that girl again. they say she got depressed—
shit, at the service all of us got tearful.
i got to thinking what an awful sight
it was, all that red blood—it wasn’t in
the papers, but i heard melissa’s mother,
who was the nurse in the emergency
that night, say how she was just covered up
in blood. i can’t think how you bring yourself
to cut your throat like that yourself—i asked
the counselor they called in to the school,
and she said something like, what better ink to write the language of the heart? i guess
it proves that stuff from bible school they say,
that such a life of sin breeds misery. phlegm “my brain is draining from my head,”
he said as once again he blew
his nose. the clock read 3 a.m.; its second hand swept slowly through
another viscous minute. dead
to even nurses sticking them for new ivs, the other ones
slept off their benders soundlessly.
“i’m losing my intelligence,” he said, and blew. my patience waned.
he thought he was the president: dementia, ks, hiv were printed in his problem list.
“and plus, i’m getting feverish.”
i can’t recall his name, but I remember hating him—grim wish
that he would hurry up and die.
just then, he took my hand, and kissed the back of it as though i were
a princess in his foreign land.
“my lady, you are beautiful,” he said, and coughed again. unsure
of what to say, my own throat burned.
he said, “you can’t know what i feel.”
bilea gun went off and killed a little girl
the day my friend was diagnosed with cancer.
i walked through central park; a black dog snarled
at squirrels chattering like they had answers. the day my friend was diagnosed with cancer
i dreamed of killing someone with a knife.
the squirrels, chattering, had likely answers
to all my angry questions about life—a homeboy threatened someone with a knife
not far from where a cop showed off his gun,
an angry answer to most questions about life.
i watched the squirrels hop, the yuppies run; the cop approached the black kids with his gun.
i wondered how much longer she would live;
the squirrels scattered when the homeboy ran.
i wondered if she’d ever been in love, i wondered who would pray for her to live,
forgive her for her anger and her weaknesses.
i wondered why it hurt to fall in love.
the cop tried aiming past me, towards the woods. forgive us for our anger, for our weaknesses:
through central park, past the black dog’s snarls,
the cop gave chase. a skirmish in the woods.
the gun went off—no! shrieked a little girl.
melancholy we picked at it with sticks at first, until
an older kid named samuel arrived.
he dropped a heavy rock right on its skull;
we watched as thick black slime began to ooze
from somewhere just below its heart—or where
we thought its heart should be. “raccoon,”
said someone solemnly. the landscaper—
sweat gleaming, like the polished figurines
my mother wouldn’t ever let me touch—
regarded us with keen suspicion from
across the street. we learned what it could teach;
like any body’s secrets, the sublime
receded toward the fact of death. i knew
both sadness, and disgust in love’s untruths.

not long ago, i studied medicine.
it was terrible, what the body told.
i’d look inside another person’s mouth,
and see the desolation of the world.
i’d see his genitals and think of sin. because my body speaks the stranger’s language,
i’ve never understood those nods and stares.
my parents held me in their arms, and still
i think i’ve disappointed them; they care
and stare, they nod, they make their pilgrimage to somewhere distant in my heart, they cry.
i look inside their other-person’s mouths
and see the wet interior of souls.
it’s warm and red in there—like love, with teeth.
i’ve studied medicine until i cried all night. through certain books, a truth unfolds.
anatomy and physiology,
the tiny sensing organs of the tongue—
each nameless cell contributing its needs.
it was fabulous, what the body told.

plankton rise toward the full moon spread thin on wakaya’s surface. manta rays’ great curls of jaw scoop backward somersaults of ocean in through painted caves of their mouths, out through sliced gills. red sea fans pulse. the leopard shark lounges on a smooth ramp of sand, skin jeweled with small hangers-on. pyramid fish point the way to the surface. ninety feet down, blue ribbon eels cough, their mouths neon cautions. ghost pipefish curl in the divemaster’s palm. soft corals unfurl rainbow polyps, thousands of mouths held open to night. currents’ communion—giant clams slam shut wavy jaws, send shivers of water. christmas tree worms snap back, flat spirals tight, living petroglyphs against the night.

one thing you know when you say it: all over the earth people are saying it with you; a child blurting it out as the seizures take her, a woman reciting it on a cot in a hospital. what if you take a cab through the tenderloin: at a street light, a man in a wool cap, yarn unraveling across his face, knocks at the window; he says, please. by the time you hear what he’s saying, the light changes, the cab pulls away, and you don’t go back, though you know someone just prayed to you the way you pray. please: a word so short it could get lost in the air as it floats up to god like the feather it is, knocking and knocking, and finally falling back to earth as rain, as pellets of ice, soaking a black branch, collecting in drains, leaching into the ground, and you walk in that weather every day.

until nightfall my son ran in the fields, looking for god knows what. flowers, perhaps. odd birds on the wing. something to fill an empty spot. maybe a luminous angel or a country girl with a secret dark. he came back empty-handed, or so i thought. now i find them: thistles, goatheads, the barbed weeds all those with hooks or horns the snaggle-toothed, the grinning ones those wearing lantern jaws, old ones in beards, leapers in silk leggings, the multiple pocked moons and spiny satellites, all those with juices and saps like the fingers of thieves nation after nation of grasses that dig in, that burrow, that hug winds and grab handholds in whatever lean place. it’s been a good day.

the nouna disease
of the peach tree
—a fungus distorts leaves.
the first time
i was taken to see him
i was five
or six. a vesicle on the skin
containing
serum, caused by friction,
a burn, or other
injury. he lived on alabama street
next to saint
peter’s and wore a white t-shirt,
starched and snug.
a similar swelling with fluid
or air
on the surface of a plant,
or metal
after cooling or the sunless
area between
one’s toes after a very
long walk.
don’t ask me
how it is i
ended up
holding it.an outer
covering
fitted to a vessel to protect
against torpedoes,
mines, or to improve stability. my guess
is that he
brought it out to show me
thinking, perhaps,
i had never seen one
up close,
let alone felt the blunt weight
of one
in my hands. a rounded
compartment
protruding from the body
of a plane.
what came next: no
image but
sensation of its hammer
(my inexpert
manipulation)
digging
into but not
breaking skin—the spot
at the base
of my thumb balloons,
slowly filling
with fluid…in spanish:
ampolla—an ampul of chrystal
in the middle
ages could bea relic containing
the blood
of someone holy. i’m fairly
certain it wasn’t

is the knife that is not marriage.

like making love or writing a poem

he screamed at me with a kind of bitterness

i want to write poems all day
i want to rise, write poems, go to sleep,
write poems in my sleep

and there i stood. i had dreamed a dream
of us in a bedroom.
the light shining upon us in white sheets. you were singing me a song of your sailing days
and in the dream
i reached deep in you and pulled out a cardinal
which in bright red
flew out the window. sometimes when we talk
on the phone, i think to myself
that the deep perfect of your soul
is what draws me to you.
but still what soul is perfect?
all souls are misshapen and off-colored.
morning comes within a soul
and makes it obey another law
in which all souls are snowflakes. once at a funeral, a man had died
and with the prayers said, his soul flew up in a hurry
like it had been let out of something awful.
it was strangely colored, that soul.
and it was a funny shape and a funny temperature.
as it blew away, all of us looking felt the cold.

into ten black snakes upon your throat
and when she does i will be wandering as i always am
a graceful lady that is part museum
of the voices of the universe everyone else forgets
i will hold your voice in a little box
and when you come upon me i won’t look back at you
you will feel a hand upon your heart while i place your voice back

the impurities of darkness
sometimes called stars. mostly
the world is assignations, divorces
conducted between rooftops. forever
and forever the checkbook unbalanced,
the beautiful bodies bent back
like paper clips, the discharged
blandishing cardboard signs by the exits.
coppers and silvers and radiant traces,
gold flecks from our last brush,
brushfires. always they’re espousing
accuracy when it’s accident, the arrow
not in the aimed-for heart but throat
that has the say. there are no transitions,
only falls.

we all think about suddenly disappearing.
the train tracks lead there, into the woods.
even in the financial district: wooden doors
in alleyways. first i want to put something small
into your hand, a button or river stone or
key i don’t know to what. i don’t
have that house anymore across from the graveyard
and its black angel. what counts as a proper
goodbye? my last winter in iowa there was always
a ladybug or two in the kitchen for cheer
even when it was ten below. we all feel
suspended over a drop into nothingness.
once you get close enough, you see what
one is stitching is a human heart. another
is vomiting wings. hell, even now i love life.
whenever you put your feet on the floor
in the morning, whatever the nightmare,
it’s a miracle or fantastic illusion:
the solidity of the boards, the steadiness
coming into the legs. where did we get
the idea when we were kids to rub dirt
into the wound or was that just in pennsylvania?
maybe poems are made of breath, the way water,
cajoled to boil, says, this is my soul, freed.

when you hear the knives ring
turn the page.
i wonder why i am not
myself of late, ridiculous glass edges
turn back on themselves
and soon reveal
the hand of an apprentice
and godforsaken embarrassing torch,
stormy back hallways
out of the black and wooden theatres.
crystal waters plus her driver
plus her entourage is still rolling out
of the sands, atlantic city
on the soundtracks to shows
held over at the fairmount
she is throwing back shots
with the mafia. i have learned
to take apart this american songbook
and very fortunately as i would take
my audience in confidence
threads of gold fall closely together
coming to break us off.
at the first of the shows
i sang this song
and in between i saw him in the hall,
what could i tell you?
“someday we’ll build on a hilltop high.”
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
in the harsh glare of an easily
reprehensible life. the channel changer is lost
in the crack of an infinite sofa.
everything falls apart, everything breaks
down, torn into a million
fragments, jericho everyday. i want to be the blameless
victim in this canceled puppet show,
the marionette every mother loves, the one
souvenirs are modeled from.(in that lifetime, elton john will write mushy ballads just
for me. michael jackson will want to be my best friend. he’d
take me to the neverland ranch, and by the llama feeding trough,
he’d say something like, “you’re a great guy, don’t give up,
stay positive!” and i’d say, “michael, you fucking idiot, i am
positive!” and he’d say, “oh, you’re so funny! would you like
to touch bubbles?”
and i would.)in the crux of my hollow innocent youth,
i believed that my teddy bears had feelings.
to cure me of this, my guardians made me give
them to the church missionaries’ children.
scrubbed-clean rosy-cheeked blonde kids who smelled
of sweat and talc, who were in constant
wide-blue-eyed bewilderment as to why
they were profusely perspiring in the tropics,
instead of living out some winter wonderland bobsey twins
fantasy, who were oblivious
to their parents’ desperate efforts
to save the dusky masses, ignorant enough
to believe in the secret lives of stuffed animals.
i could not eat animal crackers
because i did not want to hurt the poor things;
but, braised the right way, i could eat
any part of a pig, starting with the head,
working on the soft flesh around the eyes,
savoring its raspy tongue with a dipping
sauce of ginger, chilies and lime. oh blameless innocent victim.
what measures a lifetime? i used to have this theory about how
much life a human body could hold.
it all had to do with the number
of heartbeats. each human is assigned a number
determined by an unknown power cascading
over the dark waters of the unformed earth. for some, it was a magnificently high number,
seen only in richie rich comics, and for others,
it was frightfully low, like twenty-six.
no bargaining, no coupons,
no white flower day sale, no specials. once
you hit your number, you croak.
i imagined the angels in heaven
and the demons in hell gathering to watch
the counters turn, like how i enjoyed watching
the speedometer line up to a row of similar
numbers, and especially when the row of
nines turned into
the row of zeros. oh blameless innocent victim.
what measures eternity? an eternal damnation. an everlasting love. i could not imagine the night sky
stretched out forever, so i decided that it came
to an end at some point, by a velvet rope it ended
and beyond that rope were row after row of cushioned seats,
a majestic cosmic theater,
playing every movie i can remember. i want to be able to evoke
those blameless and innocent days, to revel
in their ignorance and goodness
as if they have the power
to protect and to heal,
and to strengthen,
and to bring me to safety
long after all other resources
were exhausted. but i emerge anew in the wreckage,
blinking in the sunlight, the residue of salt water in my belly. you know what they say,
god never closes a door before making sure
that the windows are barricaded
and the fire escape is inaccessible. i used to know how to stop the revolution of planets. i used to know how to save the world. now, i don’t know anything anymore.
<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>
spilling water from my back,
you call and i come.
that exhausted walk to reach you
breathless and no i didn’t run
to see you, i’ve been smoking
too much, same thing. another awkward hug in the car
as my face smashes your cheek
that i can feel it leaving now
is the saddest, a beautiful eruption
you could have picked it off the tree
and chowed but you weren’t hungry.
feeling it dying away all day
much worse than the straining
against the leash, another gorgeous
thing that should not have happened,
gone again.

white people leave the express
at 96th street, collectively,
like pigeons from a live wire
or hope from the hearts of harlem.
and i’m one of them, although
my lover sleeps two stops north between
malcolm x and adam clayton powell
boulevards, wishing my ass
were cupped inside her knees and belly,
wishing this in a dream thick
with inequalities. i live on riverside drive. my face
helped get me here. i was
ruddy with anticipation the day
i interviewed for the rooms
near the park with its
snow-covered maples. i was full
of undisguised hope as i
strolled along the river, believing
i belonged there, that my people
inherited this wonderland
unequivocally, as if they deserved it.my lover buys twinkies from the arabs,
bootleg tapes on ‘25th,
and carries a blade in her back
pocket although her hands
are the gentlest i’ve known.
she ignores the piss smells
on the corner, the sirens
at 4 a.m., the men whose brains
have dissolved in rum. and tries
to trust a white woman who
sleeps near the trees of riverside. when we go out together,
we avoid expensive
cafés on columbus avenue, jaunts
to the upper east side. harlem
eyes us suspiciously or with
contempt beneath half-closed lids.
we have friends there,
hidden in the ruins like gold, who
accept us. when it snows,
we walk boldly anywhere, as if the snow
were a protection, or a death.

long before the fresh apple crisis, my life had some form to it. i would wake in the mornings—i would perform something. for example, the day i tried, as one with acute passion might, to win one woman over but accidentally won another—that whole time i had been living like someone. though i can’t remember his name. his model of optimism provided me with a certain geography that i inhabit in time of need. this time the need was surprising. people tend to have faith that the juice they drink in the morning is the same juice they have always drunk. and apples take their shape naturally. the guy, whose name escapes me now, taught me to look upon others’ concerns as mine to make at home. i was fond of doing many things at home, but my favorite was drinking juice. when my friends came by—they liked to suddenly show up with all kinds of breads in their hands, thinking they knew what i needed and planning to force it on me—i had to tell them i was busy with my juice. two weeks before the crisis, i had been writing some poems about it. it was a warm day, not entirely different from other warm days in san francisco. people were on the street. pale people were on the street, making it to the park and lying there such that the next day they were a little browned. the poems i had written were failures, but dense ones. it seemed appropriate to think the person’s attempt at wholeness was a series of missteps, which if drawn across an afternoon might prove interesting to other people. i had a way of reminding my friends that we were all in pain, but a fruit tart kind of pain strangers can’t help but enjoy. that day i had, in a sense, gathered all my possessions and gone out onto the street with them. i awoke that morning with an urgency to prepare myself for something—not anything life threatening, but definitely personal.my lover, then, wanted to spend much of her life asleep. she had no ostensible reaction to the city’s sudden depletion of all its fresh apples and no hope for them. in a world where a person’s tastes revolve around the kind of sleep she gets, i could not find four people who cared. i thought that if i could find those four people we could really do something. a few of my friends pretended they were chosen. a few neighbors felt bad and made offers. my mother called to console me. my lover—in actuality, the closest person to being a member of the encumbered troop, slept next to me. sleep became our network: falling in and out of it for change. the rule of survival is that no two people can lie in the same bed and sleep at the same time. so i kept an eye on her and played this game of freshness. if by morning i could quickly run out and do seven things that did not involve longing, she would reward me. before the crisis, the reward would have needed only to be an apple one. but after the apples were gone. the landscape usually contains the solution to what’s lost. demographics help people in cars. some people did not notice me. some demographers lose sleep and do not notice me. that was two days before. the evening before it was two days before the crisis, i was thinking that i did not think i was asleep. i had been watching the sunlight take the corner of my room and my housemate’s cat in it. when i looked again, there was no light—but i had not been asleep. it’s the way people react to traumatic events. they say, “i had just been there” or will say, “she was just with me.” so the loss of light was emotional and the lost state—demographic. i began to trace things by their disappearance. alone in the room, my memory, and anticipated darkness going for light. people like to talk about the daytime. people in strange moods often miss the daytime. before the crisis it was not often that one would find me in strange moods. i had managed a particular kind of balance fortified by a certain satisfaction of taste. i was happy. i mean, i was in my juice. five weeks before the crisis, i was employed at the natural foods grocery around the corner from my house. i did not really work there, but i went there every week. all but the third sunday of each month, i would walk in and find all kinds of juice on sale. not to buy, but to stand next to. shorter people have the privilege of proximity to most cardboard signs. that was one thing. i would stand there and be something for taller people who couldn’t see. i had gotten into the habit of improvised customer service as a way to peruse the juice aisles without being noticed. my parents thought my talents should have led me somewhere. my father would always say, “if you’re not going to be a people person, then numbers will have to do.” he was surprised that with all the time i had on my hands, i chose to spend most of it alone. numbers then did hold some mystery for me, but mostly too high and far-reaching to explore. for years i had known that if there was a wall between where i was and where i needed to be, i did not want it there. some people have personal goals that are demanding. certain goals make it impossible to lounge around in bed. my decision to drink only fresh juice, which costs as much as a small satisfying breakfast, kept me busy rounding up cash. i would have to leave most friendships behind. as a way of keeping my life “wall-free,” i had to divide my time. i would spend the first part of the day searching for volunteer positions in organic juice factories. the second part of my day i would spend telling people about the first part. the other parts are not of substance here. twenty-five years before the crisis i had for the first time what would eventually become known to me as apple juice. twenty-three years later a magazine editor would reject my first attempt to recount that experience in litany. i am always drinking in my poems, a good friend says.in the first years of my life, everything i ate was mush. today i will tolerate only the toughest of green vegetables and date people who will always forget this. when i had that remarkable glass of apple juice, i had no idea that one day i simply would not be able to find it. the city gets rid of its apples. people find themselves inventing fruit. the day i decided to write poems about it—it was twelve days before the rumors began and fourteen days before the media coverage—i had been resting in my best friend’s easy chair. we were discussing the rise of the smoothie industry when something fantastic occurred to me. five days later i had twenty poems. when a person writes a poem about her passions, people on the street are bound to notice them. the passions overwhelm the body. she carries the body as though it were the book. the friend whose easy chair gave way to my failures moved out of town the next week, and though i miss her it was the failures that saved me. on every other day any kind of crisis one finds particular sayings helpful. if certain words are spoken quietly into a cup of hot water, with the handle of the cup turned toward the wall, whatever strength found in the person may be mirrored in the wall. the person leaves the house with her hand against this wall but strutting slightly.in the alley behind the natural foods grocery, i met my second lover for the first time. meeting people in vulnerable places accentuates the passion later. or it may be so hot that the lover never thinks in the present. and the weather was so hot during the crisis. only the alleys had shade. forty-eight days into the crisis, while on a thirst strike, i had to make a run for the alley. not as though people were after me, but the elements. the foundation of anyone feeling that they must get away is need; at the bottom of any body-based need is grace. when i appeared at the opening of the alley, a woman who not twenty-four hours later would be dozing in my bed was stacking crates against the east-side wall. women who work against surfaces inspire me to do things—i thought about telling her, or—short women make me want things. all the time while i was growing up i put a lot of demands on my juice; forty-eight days into the crisis she made me forget it. i did not forget it, but was embroiled. the newspapers were saying things about the past. people were celebrating thick juice, and i kept writing those poems. that day in the alley i realized three things about life. while assisting her i learned three things to carry around with me, to disperse when needed. for six months during the crisis, i did not care about the crisis. when my faith returned all my lovers were gone. that morning i woke to the two hundred and thirty-second day of the crisis; i was beneath my bed. it was the sixth day that i had awakened beneath my bed. i was lonely, but i was also sure. life without juice had taken on the name and shape of my weakest character, who—when we passed on the street—did not know me. i knew it was me by the way my head felt: people find themselves in an idea and feel so specified by the idea that they are compelled to show it. today all my ideas are liquid. that day of my faith, friends thinking i was sick came by to see me. it would be the last day i spent alone; i was happy, but still would not drink. the juice on my mind was no longer juice. there was an absence there, but one so constant it became familiar. i did not want to drink it.

my father had a steel comb with which he would comb our hair. after a bath the cold metal soothing against my scalp, his hand cupping
my chin.my mother had a red pullover with a little yellow duck embroidered
on it and a pendant made from a gold victoria coronation coin. which later, when we first moved to buffalo, would be stolen from
the house. the sunn’i muslims have a story in which the angels cast a dark mark
out of prophet mohammad’s heart, thus making him pure, though the
shi’a reject this story, believing in his absolute innocence from birth. telling the famous story of the blanket in which the prophet covers
himself with a yemeni blanket for his afternoon rest. joined under
the blanket first by his son-in-law ali, then each of his grandchildren
hassan and hussain and finally by his daughter bibi fatima.in heaven gabriel asks god about the five under the blanket and
god says, those are the five people whom i loved the most out of all
creation, and i made everything in the heavens and the earth for
their sake. gabriel, speaker on god’s behalf, whisperer to prophets, asks god, can
i go down and be the sixth among them. and god says, go down there and ask them. if they consent you may go
under the blanket and be the sixth among them. creation for the sake of gabriel is retroactively granted when the group
under the blanket admits him to their company.is that me at the edge of the blanket asking to be allowed inside. asking the 800 hadith be canceled, all history re-ordered.in hyderabad i prayed every part of the day, climbed a thousand steps
to the site of maula ali’s pilgrimage. i wanted to be those stairs, the hunger i felt, the river inside. i learned to pronounce my daily prayers from transliterated english
in a book called “know your islam,” dark blue with gold calligraphed
writing that made the english appear as if it were arabic complete with
marks above and below the letters. i didn’t learn the arabic script until years later and never learned the
language itself. god’s true language: hebrew. latin. arabic. sanskrit. as if utterance fit into the requirements of the human mouth. i learned how to find the new moon by looking for the circular absence
of stars. when abraham took isaac up into the thicket his son did not know
where he was being led. when his father bound him and took up the knife he was shocked. and said, “father, where is the ram?” though from abraham’s perspective he was asked by god to sacrifice
his son and proved his love by taking up the knife. thinking to himself perhaps, oh ismail, ismail, do i cut or do i burn. i learned god’s true language is only silence and breath. fourth son of a fourth son, my father was afflicted as a child and
as was the custom in those days a new name was selected for him to
protect his health. still the feeling of his rough hand, gently cupping my cheek, dipping the
steel comb in water to comb my hair flat. my hair was kept so short, combed flat when wet. i never knew my hair
was wavy until i was nearly twenty-two and never went outside with wet
and uncombed hair until i was twenty-eight. at which point i realized my hair was curly.my father’s hands have fortune-lines in them cut deeply and dramatic. the day i left his house for the last time i asked him if i could hold his
hand before i left. there are two different ways of going about this. if you have known this for years why didn’t you ask for help, he
asked me. each time i left home, including the last time, my mother would hold a
quran up for me to walk under. once under, one would turn and kiss
the book. there is no place in the quran which requires acts of homosexuality to
be punishable by lashings and death.
hadith or scripture. scripture or rupture. should i travel out from under the blanket. comfort from a verse which also recurs: “surely there are signs in this
for those of you who would reflect.” or the one hundred and four books of god. of which only four are
known—qur’an, injeel, tavrat, zubuur. there are a hundred others—bhagavad-gita, lotus sutra, song of myself, the gospel of magdalene, popul vuh, the book of black buffalowoman—somewhere unrevealed as such. dear mother in the sky you could unbuckle the book and erase all the
annotations. what i always remember about my childhood is my mother whispering
to me, telling me secrets, ideas, suggestions. she named me when i moved in her while she was reading a calligraphy
of the imam’s names. my name: translated my whole life for me as patience. in india we climbed the steps of the maula ali mountain to the top,
thirsting for what. my mother had stayed behind in the house, unable to go on pilgrimage.
she had told me the reason why. being in a state considered unacceptable for prayers or pilgrimages. i asked if she would want more children and she told me the name she
would give a new son. i always attribute the fact that they did not, though my eldest sister’s first
son was given the same name she whispered to me that afternoon, to my
telling of her secret to my sisters when we were climbing the stairs. it is the one betrayal of her—perhaps meaningless—that i have never
forgiven myself. there are secrets it is still hard to tell, betrayals hard to make. you hope like anything that though others consider you unclean god
will still welcome you. my name is kazim. which means patience. i know how to wait.

months of that

balls-out tube tops, low-riders & belly fat, the girls on the bloc kall like oh no she didn’t, and girl, she did, she was mad skills
with press-ons & a cell phone telling him where to stick it, a kid on her hip, just like that, summer, sheer beauty & lip gloss
that smelled like peaches, & you going to the store for whiskey & condoms like everyone else on a hot, long afternoon
so long & hot it would just be sunburn to walk anywhere if it weren’t also a pleasure, thoughtless & shiftless & horny & drunk,
just someone thinking summer wasn’t up to anything deep, & lo there he was, his punk ass pink as a viking in a tight
wifebeater & lingering by the public pool, drinking beer so sly it didn’t look illegal, & he wasn’t a good idea but
did you have a light? & it seemed the whole summer went like that, taking fire out of your pocket & giving it away, a ditty
you could whistle it was so cliché, like the numbers they gave you after & you never called, the number of swollen nodes of the kissing
colds you got & later the number to call to get tested, the number of the bus to the clinic, the number they gave you when they asked
you to wait, the number of questions asked, number of partners, number of risks, number of previous tests, the number of pricks
—one—to draw the blood, the number of minutes you waited before results, & then you decided you had to get the tune right,
the how to live it so it doesn’t kill you, to take a number & wait in the long line of the city’s bankrupt humanism like the bus that never comes
no matter how long you wait, & the grocery bag breaking, & if you were going to sing that one, the one that sounds like all i got is bruised
tomatoes, broken glass & dirty bread & no one waiting at home, would you.
start with genius,
as in, the spirit
of a place? & small, as in

he’s sweating,

the spirit the place

shared, just
a phrase, not a whole song,
but something
to build on? & if it isn’t bread
& if it sure
ain’t tomatoes it isn’t empty,
is it, like the signage
you walk by that fronts
the lakeside
church of practical christianity,
hawking
a knowledge of god so modest
it seems trivial?
& it isn’t ever, is it, the how
to live it
so it doesn’t kill you,
the where
to touch it, the when
will genius
sing your name so it sounds
like a place
you can live?

his hand in hold so trigger-tight its blood
believes in ghosts. it clings with finger set
on steel and waits inside a dream of ducks.
the twilight burns into a rising arc
of eastern sky as sun reveals herself
too proud and instantly receives full-face
a splash of mallard flock. a shotgun blasts
the yellow into streaming pinks and gives
the creek its new-day taste of echoed blood.
two green head ghosts fly through the pulse of dawn
upon a trigger’﻿s touch. the creek empties
of sound. in silence human fingers find
wet feet of web and carry in each hand
a bird whose only cry comes in color.

of my father’﻿s house
a hen’﻿s warm neck
once filled the center

her place on the stump
still wears my shadow
like a stain.

you marched into the gray eyes of dawn
feeling older than the bones
that held their ground
like grazing, aged cattle
waiting, eyes closed to the wind,
on a winter, slaughter morning.
you searched through the fog for a sign,
but there was no sun to burn the way,
no burst of rainbow bridge
to keep you from the cattle call.

i never thought i’d keep a record of my pain
or happiness
like candles lighting the entire soft lace
of the air
around the full length of your hair/a shower
organized by god
in brown and auburn
undulations luminous like particles
of flame but now i do
retrieve an afternoon of apricots
and water interspersed with cigarettes
and sand and rocks
we walked across:
how easily you held
my hand
beside the low tide
of the world now i do
relive an evening of retreat
a bridge i left behind
where all the solid heat
of lust and tender trembling
lay as cruel and as kind
as passion spins its infinite
tergiversations in between the bitter
and the sweet alone and longing for you

who knew it’﻿﻿﻿s quite all right that i downed three
gin-and-tonics (can’﻿﻿﻿t fit male inside
female part on fanny pack) at four
o’﻿﻿﻿clock the dyke march day of ny pride?
who knew manhattan streets would liquefy
and lurch with dames sans bras, sans hair, sans shirt
in step with beer-can band led by a skirt-
ed trans in green brassiere, led by the cops
whose sentries are staid as posts with glasses on,
lined up beside the march like s/m tops?
(they seem to think gay pride’﻿﻿﻿s this weekend’﻿﻿﻿s yawn.)
(pit stop at mcd’﻿﻿﻿s, can’﻿﻿﻿t clip pack back on.)
who knew she’﻿﻿﻿d march beside me hand-in-hand
and who’﻿﻿﻿d expect me to remember names
when liz’﻿﻿﻿s girlfriend saw us and waved “hi.
it’﻿﻿﻿s . . . anna”? (cnn shot feed, then frames.)
booze-stymied by the glare of girls and sky,
how could i choose? should i grip hand, or pray
wondering: is today today the day
she’﻿﻿﻿ll let me turn the key, lead her inside?
okay, i’﻿﻿﻿m sober now. today is just
the kind of day she talks but feels no lust.
beside her isn’﻿﻿﻿t bad. fan-stirred, the air
is humid and the theater is packed.
an ear-cuffed thespian tries to fix the cold,
our leading ladies sweat it out in back.
a prim man to my right begins to sneeze.
my nose is in agreement. the perfume
from queen mother there could clear the room.
this shadow play across her face is fine.
her arm’﻿﻿﻿s near mine, which means exactly nothing.
hope’﻿﻿﻿s hope hums on through separate listening.
that skull, opaque to me as midland’﻿﻿﻿s vault,
her silky crop, its pepper dabbed with salt —
i chuckle at an apt sardonic line.
her suede complexion, lifts up, checks the time.
les nouvceaux from la nouvelle justine
i don’﻿﻿﻿t love her. she doesn’﻿﻿﻿t love me. neither
does this waiter who may think it strange
when young girls dine with staid dames twice their age
on salade de bastille and pain de sade.
i don’﻿﻿﻿t like sitting by her like wet cloth.
i don’﻿﻿﻿t like restaurants whose queers pawn sex
to the bachelor bunch who want a thrill.
i don’﻿﻿﻿t like dining with my, well, not-ex,
both measuring the humid air for signs
of sparks i see by parts will not ignite.
i’﻿﻿﻿d rather have a knock-down, drag-out fight
that cleared the joint than watch another guy
get spanked by corset kris, who’﻿﻿﻿d like to grab
a tit, not spend hip humping hairy thighs.
i’﻿﻿﻿d rather i were twice her age and wise.
i’﻿﻿﻿d spin cruel stories of past day of bliss
then give my own hands covert exercise
and send her home to bed without a kiss.
l’﻿﻿﻿addition 30 for the play and 10 for gins,
10 for two cabs and 40 for the eats,
at least the metro home was freezer-cold,
at least the broadway local still had seats
at 96th, the local went express.
i blistered home ten sockless humid blocks
back to my solo digs for solo sex.
i got this poem for my 90 bucks.

darkened not completely dark let us walk in the darkened field
trees in the field outlined against that which is less dark
under the trees are bushes with orange berries dark green leaves
not poetry’﻿﻿s mixing of yellow light blue sky darker than that
darkness of the leaves a modulation of the accumulated darkness
orange of the berries another modulation spreading out toward us
it is like the reverberation of a bell rung three times
like the call of a voice the call of a voice that is not there. we will not look up how they got their name in a book of names
we will not trace the name’﻿﻿s root conjecture its first murmuring
the root of the berries their leaves is succoured by darkness
darkness like a large block of stone hauled on a wooden sled
like stone formed and reformed by a dark sea rolling in turmoil.

and it hurts not good but
bad
to see a man head in hands in tears it breaks you up
to see a man come down in tears. there are birds there is birdsong

there is free song
a free weaving of many songs
song against song and other songs clustered/spun out in a blending of wavy pitches
tant
doucement the phrase means what the songs mean
freshness
that meaning so sweetly and freely as a gardener weaves flowers in her hair.
can we stay in the weave of

love tomorrow its unseen/secret structure when our time remains a
bad time and what time wasn’﻿﻿t

how long will the bed that we made together
hold us there? ﻿your stubbled cheeks grazed my skin﻿
from evening to dawn, a cloud of scattered
particles now, islands of shaving foam
slowly spiraling down the drain, blood drops
stippling the water pink as i kiss
the back of your neck, our faces framed inside
a medicine cabinet mirror. the blade
of your hand carves a portal out of steam,
the two of us like boys behind frosted glass
who wave goodbye while a car shoves off
into winter. all that went unnoticed
till now — empty cups of coffee stacked up
in the sink, the neighborhood kids
up to their necks in mounds of autumn leaves.
how months on a kitchen calendar drop
like frozen flies, the flu season at its peak
followed by a train of magic-markered
xxx’﻿﻿﻿s — nights we’﻿﻿﻿d spend apart. death must work
that way, a string of long distance calls
that only gets through to the sound of your voice
on our machine, my heart’﻿﻿﻿s mute confession
screened out. how long before we turn away
from flowers altogether, your blind hand
reaching past our bedridden shoulders
to hit that digital alarm at delayed
intervals — till you shut it off completely.

i went to my mother’s room at 13
past midnight, and told her i was dying.
i’d wet the bed, i’d had this crazy dream,
about a sexy neighbor i’d been spying
on. well, i didn’t tell her that. i mean,
the day before she asked who i was eyeing
when i didn’t want to go outside
for ice cream. the truck was parked out front,
and she was buying, but i couldn’t join
the other screaming kids —
not with lance applying suntan lotion
to his muscled teenage skin.
stretched out on a beach towel
in his front yard, his body mystified me,
while mine seemed happy to defy me.
my dick would tent my cut-offs
at the sight of him.
i wore two pair of underwear,
but even then i thought i’d burst
right through the seams.
so i didn’t dare tell mother what i’d dreamed,
though she did think to ask me.
i’d have been a fool to tell her that.
she thought my blush was any boy’s,
puzzling out his sexuality, but i swear it was
as much because the fantasies
were always other boys.
some from my baseball team,
some the roughnecks at school,
but usually lance. he was flying
naked in the dream i had that night,
the one that made me think that god
was mad and killing me. i was lying
(also naked — and hard as cinder block)
on the beach towel i’d seen him lay
across the grass the day before.
i tried to understand the signs implying
i might turn into some kind of freaky thing.
but it would have been cruel to tell my mother that,
especially when she was already crying,
and trying not to laugh at the same time,
when i showed her what came out of me.
she apologized for throwing such a scene,
said i was growing up to be a man, that’s all it meant,
said it was normal for a boy my age’s thing
to start uprising like a metal beam.
she apologized again
that i didn’t have my dad around to train
an 11-year old boy in the ways of puberty.
i was as stupefied as i’ve ever been.
she never mentioned him.
and i have never turned a deeper red
than i did then, at 26 past midnight,
when my mother helped me change my sheets,
and said the next day she’d teach me to wash them.
and then she said she’d ask the man across the street
to talk to me. would that be okay?
or would i feel more comfortable
with someone younger, like his son?

it wasn’﻿t over a woman that war began, but it’﻿s better
to see it this way, my myth professor loved to say, a man
from the south rumored to extort the bodies of college girls
into higher grades. my girlfriend of the time told me so —he was a creep, she
got an a in the class and liked his joke about religion
as self-mutilation, it was ramadan then and, o helen,
i was fasting. i lie awake in a desert night east of the atlantic on the verge of rain, the catapulted grains
of sand on hot zinc roof, the rustle of leaves, the flap
of peeling bark on trees whose names i do not know, and where
would i find a botany guide here. water flowed like a river from the jabal once.
there were elephant pools, alligator
streams, and a pond for the devil to speak in human tongues.
all desiccant names now after an earthquake shuffled the ground decades ago. it will rain soon,
i’﻿m assured, since nothing has stopped
the birds from migration. all the look-alikes
are already here: the stork, the heron. the white flying flowers, the ibis, and the one
that aesthetizes you more.

at a desk made of glass,
in a glass walled-room
with red airport carpet, an officer asked
my father for fingerprints,
and my father refused, so another offered him tea
and he sipped it. the teacup
template for fingerprints.my father says, it was just
hot water with a bag.
my father says, in his country, because the earth knows
the scent of history,
it gave the people sage. i like my tea with sage
from my mother’﻿s garden,
next to the snapdragons she calls fish mouths
coming out for air. a remedy
for stomach pains she keeps in the kitchen where
she always sings.
first, she is boiling water
where tea is loosened.
then she drops in it a pinch of sage
and lets it sit a while.
she tells a story: the groom arrives late
to his wedding
wearing only one shoe. the bride asks him
about the shoe. he tells her
he lost it while jumping over a house-wall.
breaking away from soldiers.
she asks: tea with sage
or tea with mint? with sage, he says,
sweet scent, bitter tongue.
she makes it, he drinks.

between what should and what should not be
everything is liable to explode. many times
i was told who has no land has no sea. my father
learned to fly in a dream. this is the story
of a sycamore tree he used to climb
when he was young to watch the rain. sometimes it rained so hard it hurt. like being
beaten with sticks. then the mud would run red.my brother believed bad dreams could kill
a man in his sleep, he insisted
we wake my father from his muffled screams
on the night of the day he took us to see his village.
no longer his village he found his tree amputated.
between one falling and the next there’﻿s a weightless state. there was a woman
who loved me. asked me how to say tree
in arabic. i didn’﻿t tell her. she was sad. i didn’﻿t understand.
when she left. i saw a man in my sleep three times. a man i knew
could turn anyone into one-half reptile.
i was immune. i thought i was. i was terrified of being the only one left. when we woke my father
he was running away from soldiers. now
he doesn’﻿t remember that night. he laughs
about another sleep, he raised his arms to strike a king
and tried not to stop. he flew
but mother woke him and held him for an hour, or half an hour, or as long as it takes a migration inward.
maybe if i had just said it. shejerah, she would’﻿ve remembered me longer. maybe
i don’﻿t know much about dreams
but my mother taught me the law of omen. the dead

the rice field birds are too clever for scarecrows,
they know what they love, milk in the grain. when it happens, there will be no time to look for anyone.
husband, children, nine brothers and sisters. you will drop your sugarcane-stick-beating of plastic bucket,
stop shouting at birds and run. they will load you in trucks and herd you for a hundred miles.
old men will teach you trade with soldiers at checkpoints. you will give them your spoon, blanket and beans,
they’﻿﻿﻿﻿ll let you keep your life. and if you jump off the truck, the army jeep trailing it will run you over.
later, they will accuse you of giving up your land. later, you will stand in distribution lines and won’﻿﻿﻿t receive enough to eat.
your mother will weave you new underwear from flour sacks. and they’﻿﻿﻿ll give you plastic tents, cooking pots,
vaccine cards, white pills, and wool blankets. and you will keep your cool.
standing with eyes shut tight like you’﻿﻿﻿ve got soap in them. arms stretched wide like you’﻿﻿﻿re catching rain.

here, shooting stars linger
they give out
a sparkling trail like a cauterized incision silver, or amber
if the moon is low and rising red
and the rain melts the roads

can rupture a spleen
or oust a kidney stone as for the heart
it needs a beginning

“mize, zey eat mize”
the frenchman exclaimed with a smile
“rraized and shipped from za states” we raise rats! i thought
that’﻿s a lot of protein! “maize maize!” it was, after our chickens

she spoke seven languages and died suddenly
he was a merchant
he’﻿s a doorman now and buys us cigarettes
here we are with love pouring out of every orifice
here they are dancing
around the funeral pyre, the corpse in absentia
one of the drivers ran over the neighbor’﻿s ducks
the neighbor demanded compensation
for the post-traumatic stress disorder he accurately anticipates do you know what it’﻿s like
to drive on roads occupied
by animal farms: you cannot tell
who killed who or how
many ducks were there to begin with
in the morning, elephant grass moves the way
mist is visible in the breeze but doesn’﻿t dampen the skin.
today, i yelled at three old women
who wouldn’﻿t stop bargaining for pills they didn’﻿t need
one wanted extra
for her grandson who came along for the ride.
like lip sores
the asphalt blisters in the rain and the boys
fill the holes with dirt and gravel
and broken green branches
then wait: no windex. no flowers or newspapers
and gratuity is appreciated.
“i have ants in my leg”
and “my leg went to sleep”
are not the same thing! the french argue
there is no sleep in a tingling numbness
the symptom of sluggish blood: i agree. me too my leg has been anted
and we are learning to reconcile
the dark with the electric.
four days the river runs to the border
nine days to learn it wasn’﻿t the shape
of your nose that gave you away
and debts are paid off in a-shelter-for-a-daya pile of wood plus change in your pocket

no more running long or short distance
the old women
snicker at me when i pass them by.
she was comatose post-partum
and the beekeeper
bathed her in love everyday when she recovered i gave up
what he’﻿d promised me for the woman
who took up nursing their newborn
since as coincidence would have it
her name was om assel — mother of honey.
the translation of a medical interview
is not a poem to be written come recite a verse from childhood with me
i see you’﻿re unable to weep, does love have no command over you? 
the sea’﻿s like the desert neither quenches the thirst.
here, dry grass burns the moon
here, a clearing of grass is a clearing of snakes.
and the rain has already been cleansed from the sky
the clinic is empty, soon
the earth will unseal like a jar
harvest is the season that fills the belly.
here, i ride my bicycle invisible
except for a crescent shadow and the milky way
is already past.
and a mirror gives the moon back to the moon
home is an epilogue: which came first
memory or words?

i spent a night turning in bed,
my love was a feather, a flatsleeping thing. she was
very white and quiet, and above us on
the roof, there was another woman I also loved, had
addressed myself to in a fit she
returned. that encompasses it. but now i was
lonely, i yelled, but what is that? ugh,
she said, beside me, she put her hand on
my back, for which act i think to say this
wrongly.

tonight, nothing is long enough—
time isn’﻿t.
were there a fire,
it would burn now. were there a heaven,
i would have gone long ago.

is the final image. but time reoccurs,
love—and an echo.
a time passes
love in the dark.

all night the sound had
come back again,
and again falls
this quiet, persistent rain. what am i to myself
that must be remembered,
insisted upon
so often? is it that never the ease,
even the hardness,
of rain falling
will have for me something other than this,
something not so insistent—
am i to be locked in this
final uneasiness. love, if you love me,
lie next to me.
be for me, like rain,
the getting out of the tiredness, the fatuousness, the semi-
lust of intentional indifference.
be wet
with a decent happiness.

why go further? one might conceivably rectify the rhythm, study all out and arrive at the perfection of a tiger lily or a china doorknob. one might lift all out of the ruck, be a worthy successor to—the man in the moon. instead of breaking the back of a willing phrase why not try to follow the wheel through—approach death at a walk, take in all the scenery. there﻿’﻿s as much reason one way as the other and then—one never knows—perhaps we’﻿ll bring back eurydice—this time!
﻿between two contending forces there may at all times arrive that moment when the stress is equal on both sides so that with a great pushing a great stability results giving a picture of perfect rest. and so it may be that once upon the way the end drives back upon the beginning and a stoppage will occur. at such a time the poet shrinks from the doom that is calling him forgetting the delicate rhythms of perfect beauty, preferring in his mind the gross buffetings of good and evil fortune.
ay dio! i would say so much were it not for the tunes changing, changing, darting so many ways. one step and the cart’﻿s left you sprawling. here’﻿s the way! and—you’﻿re hip bogged. and there’﻿s blame of the light too: when eyes are humming birds who’﻿ll tie them with a lead string? but it’﻿s the tunes they want most,—send them skipping out at the tree tops. whistle then! who’﻿d stop the leaves swarming; curving down the east in their braided jackets? well enough—but there’﻿s small comfort in naked branches when the heart’﻿s not set that way. 
a man’﻿s desire is to win his way to some hilltop. but against him seem to swarm a hundred jumping devils. these are his constant companions, these are the friendly images which he has invented out of his mind and which are inviting him to rest and to disport himself according to hidden reasons. the man being half a poet is cast down and longs to rid himself of his torment and his tormentors. 
when you hang your clothes on the line you do not expect to see the line broken and them trailing in the mud. nor would you expect to keep your hands clean by putting them in a dirty pocket. however and of course if you are a market man, fish, cheeses and the like going under your fingers every minute in the hour you would not leave off the business and expect to handle a basket of fine laces without at least mopping yourself on a towel, soiled as it may be. then how will you expect a fine trickle of words to follow you through the intimacies of this dance without—oh, come let us walk together into the air awhile first. one must be watchman to much secret arrogance before his ways are tuned to these measures. you see there is a dip of the ground between us. you think you can leap up from your gross caresses of these creatures and at a gesture fling it all off and step out in silver to my finger tips. ah, it is not that i do not wait for you, always! but my sweet fellow—you have broken yourself without purpose, you are—hark! it is the music! whence does it come? what! out of the ground? is it this that you have been preparing for me? ha, goodbye, i have a rendezvous in the tips of three birch sisters. encouragez vos musiciens! ask them to play faster. i will return—later. ah you are kind.—and i? must dance with the wind, make my own snow flakes, whistle a contrapuntal melody to my own fugue! huzza then, this is the dance of the blue moss bank! huzza then, this is the mazurka of the hollow log! huzza then, this is the dance of rain in the cold trees.

i walked in the house
on the flat aspect of the wood
i took rectangular instruction of the wood when i walked i turned at the wall
and on the flat i moved steadily unimpeded, not tumbling, climbing or short of breath.
i walked in ease on the flat. something electric charged into our account
and zinged out of it, pre-instructed and paid for the house. i felt
house on my heel then instep and toe.
i had a bad foot and i paid
to get it fixed so i could walk here.
i paid for the house and i paid for the
foot that touches it. i paid to be
directed rectangularly and down a hall.
i curved my body to direct
my waste through a hole. i am helped
and paying for it. all of me exchanged,
housing exchange. i saw us standing
up in the world.
and we sank into
exchange
vibrating transparency
like a sea nettle
afloat in the night sea the edges of the sea-veil
tensed slapping above, visible
when the wind crevassed and doilied if there is a ceiling to exchange
and above it sky
i don’t can’t see it and i don’t know why
i want it
above my house which is crystalline gel edges because the whole world’s disappeared
viewed as exchange i broke my arm and the window
integrally to exchange. i paid someone to fix me and improve
the window, triple-glazing it, and warmer
i rebounded knit in knit up.
all parties to the event’s aftermath
were paid. suppose i did not go in pain
to hospital, did not visit and revisit
for x-rays, left the window smashed
and sat here by it,
stuck up
among the crystalline
and cold.
i was painful and determined
not to play, and with the other unemployed
weighed —the ghostship
sagged with holes.—so you want to be a thing outside exchange? drain out the dying bath
see what color you are? the coin changed hands identical with a will
to transact.

amazing the mood it's put me in.
and the sky's tint at this hour—out
on my own, occasional hum or zip
of a car, august the summer month
half the city splashes about
the mediterranean, or north:
the beach at donostia a jewel
—its paseo the lip of a shell to walk.
it's hearing you what really pulls
me in, soft this interior punch,
recalling the sheen of your brow—we'd talk
with our limbs, the liffey below, have lunch...
re-lived this evening on the phone;
the pitch of your dublin tone.

little paper cuds we made by ripping the corners or edges from homework and class notes then ruminating them into balls we’d flick from our fingertips or catapult with pencils or (sometimes after lunch) launch through striped straws like deadly projectiles toward the necks of enemies and any other target where they’d stick with the tiniest splat, i hope you’re still there, stuck to unreachable ceilings like the beginnings of nests by generations of wasps too ignorant to finish them or under desktops with blunt stalactites of chewing gum, little white words we learned to shape and hold in our mouths while waiting to let them fly, our most tenacious utterance.

out in the orchards the dogs stood almost frozen in the bleak spring night & mister dragged out into the rows between his peach trees the old dry limbs building at regular intervals careful pyres while the teeth of the dogs chattered & snapped & the ice began to hang long as whiskers from the globes along the branches & at his signal we set the piles of branches ablaze tending each carefully so as not to scorch the trees as we steadily fed those flames just enough to send a rippling glow along those acres of orchard where that body—sister winter—had been held so wisely to the fire

we are as clouds that veil the midnight moon;
how restlessly they speed and gleam and quiver, streaking the darkness radiantly! yet soonnight closes round, and they are lost for ever:
—or like forgotten lyres whose dissonant strings
give various response to each varying blast, to whose frail frame no second motion brings
one mood or modulation like the last.
we rest—a dream has power to poison sleep;
we rise—one wandering thought pollutes the day; we feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep, embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:
—it is the same!—for, be it joy or sorrow,
the path of its departure still is free; man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;
nought may endure but mutability.

this particular thing, whether it be four pinches of four divers white powders cleverly compounded to cure surely, safely, pleasantly a painful twitching of the eyelids or say a pencil sharpened at one end, dwarfs the imagination, makes logic a butterfly, offers a finality that sends us spinning through space, a fixity the mind could climb forever, a revolving mountain, a complexity with a surface of glass; the gist of poetry. 
there is no thing that with a twist of the imagination cannot be something else. porpoises risen in a green sea, the wind at nightfall bending the rose-red grasses and you—in your apron running to catch—say it seems to you to be your son. how ridiculous! you will pass up into a cloud and look back at me, not count the scribbling foolish that puts wings to your heels, at your knees. 
sooner or later as with the leaves forgotten the swinging branch long since and summer: they scurry before a wind on the frost-baked ground—have no place to rest—somehow invoke a burst of warm days not of the past nothing decayed: crisp summer!—neither a copse for resurrected frost eaters but a summer removed
undestroyed a summer of dried leaves scurrying with a screech, to and fro in the half dark—twittering, chattering, scraping. hagh! 
seeing the leaves dropping from the high and low branches the thought rise: this day of all others is the one chosen, all other days fall away from it on either side and only itself remains in perfect fullness. it is its own summer, of its leaves as they scrape on the smooth ground it must build its perfection. the gross summer of the year is only a halting counterpart of those fiery days of secret triumph which in reality themselves paint the year as if upon a parchment, giving each season a mockery of the warmth or frozenness which is within ourselves. the true seasons blossom or wilt not in fixed order but so that many of them may pass in a few weeks or hours whereas sometimes a whole life passes and the season remains of a piece from one end to the other.﻿

this is a slight stiff dance to a waking baby whose arms have been lying curled back above his head upon the pillow, making a flower—the eyes closed. dead to the world! waking is a little hand brushing away dreams. eyes open. here’﻿﻿﻿s a new world.
﻿
there is nothing the sky-serpent will not eat. sometimes it stops to gnaw fujiyama, sometimes to slip its long and softly clasping tongue about the body of a sleeping child who smiles thinking its mother is lifting it. 
security, solidity—we laugh at them in our clique. it is tobacco to us, this side of her leg. we put it in our samovar and make tea of it. you see the stuff has possibilities. you think you are opposing the rich but the truth is you’﻿﻿﻿re turning toward authority yourself, to say nothing of religion. no, i do not say it means nothing. why everything is nicely adjusted to our moods. but i would rather describe to you what i saw in the kitchen last night—overlook the girl a moment: there over the sink (1) this saucepan holds all, (2) this colander holds most, (3) this wire sieve lets most go and (4) this funnel holds nothing. you appreciate the progression. what need then to be always laughing? quit phrase making—that is, not of course—but you will understand me or if not—why—come to breakfast sometime around evening on the fourth of january any year you please; always be punctual where eating is concerned. 
my little son’﻿﻿﻿s improvisations exceed min: a round stone to him’﻿﻿﻿s a loaf of bread or “this hen could lay a dozen golden eggs.” birds fly about his bedstead; giants lean over him with hungry jaws; bears roam the farm by summer and are killed and quartered at a thought. there are interminable stories at eating time full of bizarre imagery, true grotesques, pigs that change to dogs in the telling, cows that sing, roosters that become mountains and oceans that fill a soup plate. there are groans and growls, dun clouds and sunshine mixed in a huge phantasmagoria that never rests, never ceased to unfold into—the day’﻿﻿﻿s poor little happenings. not that alone. he has music which i have not. his tunes follow no scale, no rhythm—alone the mood in odd ramblings up and down, over and over with a rigor of invention that rises beyond the power to follow except in some more obvious flight. never have i heard so crushing a critique as those desolate inventions, involved half-hymns, after his first visit to a christian sunday school.
this song is to phyllis! by this deep snow i know it’﻿﻿﻿s springtime, not ring time! good god no! the screaming brat’﻿﻿﻿s a sheep bleating, the rattling crib-side sheep shaking a bush. we are young! we are happy! says colin. what’﻿﻿﻿s an icy room and the sun not up? this song is to phyllis. reproduction lets death in, says joyce. rot, say i. to phyllis this song is! 
that which is known has value only by virtue of the dark. this cannot be otherwise. a thing known passes out of the mind into the muscles, the will is quit of it, save only when set into vibration by the forces of darkness opposed to it. ﻿

the brutal lord of all will rip us from each other—leave the one to suffer here alone. no need belief in god or hell to postulate that much. the dance: hands touching, leaves touching—eyes looking, clouds rising—lips touching, cheeks touching, arm about . . . sleep. heavy head, heavy arm, heavy dream—: of ymir’﻿﻿s flesh the earth was made and of his thoughts were all the gloomy clouds created. oya! 
out of bitterness itself the clear wine of the imagination will be pressed and the dance prosper thereby. 
to you! whoever you are, wherever you are! (but i know where you are!) there’﻿﻿s dü﻿rer’﻿﻿s “nemesis” naked on her sphere over the little town by the river—except she’﻿﻿s too old. there’﻿﻿﻿s a dancing burgess by tenier and villon’﻿﻿﻿s maitresse—after he’﻿﻿﻿d gone bald and was skin pocked and toothless: she that had him ducked in the sewage drain. then there’﻿﻿﻿s that miller’﻿﻿﻿s daughter of “buttocks broad and breastes high.” something of nietzsche, something of the good samaritan, something of the devil himself,—can cut a caper of a fashion, my fashion! hey you, the dance! squat. leap. hips to the left. chin—ha!—sideways! stand up, stand up ma bonne! you’﻿﻿﻿ll break my backbone. so again!—and so forth till we’﻿﻿﻿re sweat soaked. 
some fools once were listening to a poet reading his poem. it so happened that the words of the thing spoke of gross matters of the everyday world such as are never much hidden from a quick eye. out of these semblances, and borrowing certain members from fitting masterpieces of antiquity, the poet began piping up his music, simple fellow, thinking to please his listeners. but they getting the whole matter sadly muddled in their minds made such a confused business of listening that not only were they not pleased at the poet﻿’﻿s exertions but no sooner had he done than they burst out against him with violent imprecations. 3
it’﻿s all one. richard worked years to conquer the descending cadence, idiotic sentimentalist. ha, for happiness! this tore the dress in ribbons from her maid’﻿﻿s back and not spared the nails either; wild anger spit from her pinched eyes! this is the better part. or a child under a table to be dragged out coughing and biting, eyes glittering evilly. i’﻿﻿ll have it my way! nothing is any pleasure but misery and brokenness. this is the only up-cadence. this is where the secret rolls over and opens its eyes. bitter words spoken to a child ripple in morning light! boredom from a bedroom doorway thrills with anticipation! the complaints of an old man dying piecemeal are starling chirrups. coughs go singing on springtime paths across a field; corruption picks strawberries and slow warping of the mind, blacking the deadly walls—counted and recounted—rolls in the grass and shouts ecstatically. all is solved! the moaning and dull sobbing of infants sets blood tingling and eyes ablaze to listen. speed sings in the heels at long nights tossing on coarse sheets with bruning sockets staring into the black. dance! sing! coil and uncoil! whip yourselves about! shout the deliverance! an old woman has infected her blossomy grand-daughter with a blood illness that every two weeks drives the mother into hidden songs of agony, the pad-footed mirage of creeping death for music. the face muscles keep pace. then a darting about the compass in a tarantelle that wears flesh from bones. here is dancing! the mind in tatters. and so the music wistfully takes the lead. ay de mí﻿, juana la loca, reina de españ﻿a, esa está﻿ tu canta, reina mí﻿a!﻿

why pretend to remember the weather two years back? why not? listen close then repeat after others what they have just said and win a reputation for vivacity. oh feed upon petals of edelweiss! one dew drop, if it be from the right flower, is five years’ drink! 
having once taken the plunge the situation that preceded it becomes obsolete which a moment before was alive with malignant rigidities.
when beldams dig clams their fat hams (it’s always beldams) balanced near tellus’s hide, this rhinoceros pelt, these lumped stone—buffoonery of midges on a bull’s thigh—invoke,—what you will: birth’s glut, awe at god’s craft, youth’s poverty, evolution of a child’s caper, man’s poor inconsequence. eclipse of all things; sun’s self turned hen’s rump. cross a knife and fork and listen to the church bells! it is the harvest moon’s made wine of our blood. up over the dark factory into the blue glare start the young poplars. they whisper: it is sunday! it is sunday! but the laws of the country have been stripped bare of leaves. out over the marshes flickers our laughter. a lewd anecdote’s the chase. on through the vapory heather! and there at banter’s edge the city looks at us sidelong with great eyes—lifts to its lips heavenly milk! lucina, o lucina! beneficent cow, how have we offended thee? 
hilariously happy because of some obscure wine of the fancy which they have drunk four rollicking companions take delight in the thought that they have thus evaded the stringent laws of the county. seeing the distant city bathed in moonlight and staring seriously at them they liken the moon to a cow and its light to milk.

needs jealousy, and death

or goose it back alive.

but from my southern side i pluck a phrase,
“i’ll carry you.” and it means “rest in me,”
to hold you as i may, in my mind’s womb. but snap the album, get the guidebook out!
rotterdam: her raw, gray waterfront,
zadkine’s memorial burning on the quay;
this bronze is mortal, gaping in defeat,
the form that wombed it split to let it be.
it mends; he lurches up, in blood reborn,
the empty heavens his eternal frame.
move to my room beside the golden horn
where minarets strike fire against the sky.
the architecture: breasts and phalluses.
where are the words to say that words are lies?
yeats lied. and here byzantium lies dead.
constantinople? syllables in a text.
istanbul. real. embalmed in dancing dust. everywhere the dark-brown past gives way
to the beige of progress, that wide vacant lot.
turkey without coffee! endlessly we sip tea
from bud vases, and i lust for the guide,
a sultry, serious, pedantic boy
in a tight brown suit, thirsting to get out
of the triple city weighing on his mind.
oh, he was doomed, doomed like the dogs
on dog island, in the sea,
netted and dumped and exiled, left to die,
then skinned. we heard imaginary canine howls,
like the rustlings of a thousand gauzy girls,
film-eyed cattle, perishing of ennui
in abandoned harems where he guided me.
meanwhile the faithful, prostrate and intoning,
stare into the light as blind as death,
knowing for sure their end is instant heaven.
we infidels concede them paradise,
having seen heaven-as-harem, a eunuch god
in charge: the virgin slowly fattening to blubber.
love, become feminized, tickles like a feather.
the saints of art? sophia, that vast barn
holds no small savior waiting to get born.
the formal scribble on the assaulted walls—
five hundred years of crossing out his name!
some famous, glittering pebbles mark the place
as god’s most grandiose sarcophagus.
decay, decay. and the mind, a fetus, dies.
return me to the airfield near shanghai
where i am very young: shy, apprehensive,
seated like sheba on a baggage mountain
waiting for the first adventure to begin.
the train will glide through fields of rice and men,
bodies like thongs, and glorious genitals,
not alien as chinese, but adam-strange.
rejoiced by her first look at naked men,
her soul swims out the window of the train!
she goes where newborn daughters clog the creeks;
bank-porticoes are strewn with starving rags.
here the old dragon, china, thrashes, dying.
but the ancient, virile music of the race
is rising, drenched in gongs and howls of dogs islanded, the sighs of walled-up women
dreaming of peasants in their prisoning fields…
but we break out of the harem of history!
no longer that young foreigner on the train,
i listen like a bird, although i ruminate
like a cow, in my pale holland body, riven
by love and children. these eyes are what they see.
come die with me in the mosques of rotterdam.

last night i dreamed i ran through the streets of new york
looking for help for you, nicanor.
but my few friends who are rich or influential
were temporarily absent from their penthouses or hotel suites.
they had gone to the opera, or flown for the weekend to bermuda.
at last i found one or two of them at home,
preparing for social engagements,
absently smiling, as they tried on gown after gown
until heaps of rich, beautiful fabric were strewn
over the chairs and sofas. they posed before mirrors,
with their diamonds and trinkets and floor-length furs.
smiling at me from the mirror, they vaguely promised help.
they became distracted—by constantly ringing phones,
by obsequious secretaries, bustling in with packages,
flowers, messages, all the paraphernalia,
all part of the uninterruptible rounds of the rich,
the nice rich, smiling soothingly, as they touched their hair
or picked up their phone extensions.
absently patting my arm, they smiled, “it will be all right.”
dusk fell on the city as i ran, naked, weeping, into the streets.
i ran to the home of barbara, my friend,
who, as a young girl, rescued four loyalist soldiers
from a spanish prison;
in her teenage sweater set and saddle shoes and knee socks,
she drove an old car sagging with loyalist pamphlets
across the pyrenees all the way to paris without being caught.
and not long ago, she helped save a group of men
from franco’s sentence of death.in my dream, barbara telephones barcelona.
i realize this isn’t quite right,
but i just stand there paralyzed, as one does in dreams.
then, dimly, from the other end of the line,
through the chatter of international operators,
we hear artillery fire, the faint tones of lost men,
cracked voices singing, “los quartros generales” through the pulsations
of the great, twisted cable under the ocean. agonía, agonía, sueño, fermente & sueño. este es el mundo, amigo, agonía, agonía.“no, barbara!” i scream. "we are not back there.
that’s the old revolution. call up the new one.”
though i know that, every day,
your friends, nicanor, telephone santiago,
where the number rings and rings and rings
with never an answer. and now the rings
are turning into knells: the church bells of santiago
tolling the funeral of neruda, his poems looted,
his autobiography stolen, his books desecrated
in his house on isla negra.
and among the smashed glass, the broken furniture,
his desk overturned, the ruined books strewn over the floor,
lie the great floral wreaths from the swedish academy,
the wreaths from paris, south asia, the whole world over.
and the bells toll on…
then i tell barbara to hang up the phone. she dials the number again, then turns to me, smiling,
smiling like an angel:
“he is there.” trembling, i take the phone from her,
and hear your voice, nicanor,
sad, humorous, infinitely disillusioned,
infinitely consoling:
“dear carolyn…” it is nicanor!
and the connection is broken, because i wake up,
in this white room, in this white silence,
in this backwater of silence
on this isla blanca:
nicanor, nicanor,
are you, too, silent under the earth,
brother, brother?

the poets are going home now,
after the years of exile,
after the northern climates
where they worked, lectured, remembered,
where they shivered at night
in an indifferent world.
where god was the god of business,
and men would violate the poets’ moon,
and even the heavens become zones of war. the poets are going home
to the blood-haunted villages,
to the crumbling walls, still pocked
with a spray of bullets;
to the ravine, marked with a new cross,
where their brother died.
no one knows the precise spot where they shot him,
but there is a place now to gather, to lay wreaths.
the poets will bring flowers. the poets are coming home
to the cafés, to the life of the streets at twilight,
to slip among the crowds and greet their friends;
thee young poets, old now, limping, who lean on a cane:
or the arm of a grandchild, peer with opaque eyes
at the frightening city, the steel and concrete towers
sprung up in their absence.
yet from open doorways comes the odor of grapes
fermented, of fish, of oil, of pimiento…the poets have come home
to the melodious language
that settles in their heads like moths alighting,
this language for which they starved
in a world of gutturals,
crude monosyllables barked by strangers.
now their own language enfolds them
with its warm vocables.
the poets are home. yes, they have come back
to look up at the yellow moon,
cousin of that cold orb that only reflected
their isolation.
they have returned to the olives, the light,
the sage-scented meadows,
the whitewashed steps, the tubs of geraniums,
the sere plains, the riverbanks spread with laundry,
the poppies, the vineyards, the bones of mountains. yes, poets, welcome home
to your small country
riven by its little war
(as the world measures these events),
a country that remembers heroes and tears;
where, in your absence, souls kept themselves alive
by whispering your words.
now you smile at everything, even the priests, the militia,
the patient earth that is waiting to receive you.

thousands lavishing, thousands starving;
intrigues, war, flatteries, envyings, hypocrisies, lying vanities, hollow amusements,
exhaustion, dissipation, death—and giddiness
and laughter, from the first scene to the last.
—samuel palmer, 1858.
pan awakes: summer marches in pan’s
spring rain
“drives his victims
out to the animals
with whom they become
as one”—pain and paeans,
hung in the mouth, to be sung.
what the flowers in the meadow tell me june 6, 1857, thoreau in his journal:
a year is made up of a certain series and number of sensations and thoughts which have their language in nature…
now i am ice, now i am sorrel. or, clare, 1840, epping forest:
i found the poems in the fields and only wrote them down and the book i love is everywhere and not in idle words john, claritas tell us the words are not idle,
the syllables are able
to turn plantains into quatrains,
tune raceme to cyme, panicle and umbel to
form corollas in light clusters of tones…sam palmer hit it:
“milton, by one epithet
draws an oak of the largest girth i ever saw,
‘pine and monumental oak’:
i have just been trying to draw a large one in
lullingstone; but the poet’s tree is huger than
any in the park.” muse in a meadow, compose in

what the animals in the forest tell me harris’s sparrow—103 species seen
by the georgia ornithological society
in rabun gap,including harris’s sparrow, with its
black crown, face, and bib encircling
a pink bill it was, i think, the third sighting
in georgia, and i should have been there
instead of reading clare, listening to
catbirds and worrying about turdus migratorious that flew
directly into the volkswagen and
bounced into a ditch friend robin, i cannot figure it, if i’d
been going 40 you might be
whistling in some grass. 10 tepid people got 10 stale letters
one day earlier,
i cannot be happy
about that.
what the night tells me the dark drones on
in the southern wheat fields
and the hop flowers
open before the sun’s
beckoning the end
is ripeness, the wind
rises,
and the dawn says
yes yes! it says
“yes” 
what the morning bells tell me sounds, and sweet aires that give delight and hurt not—that, let
shakespeare’s
delectation
bear us. 
what love tells me anton bruckner counts the 877th leaf
on a linden tree in the countryside near wien
and prays: dear god, sweet jesus,
save us, save us…the light in the grass,
the wind on the hill, are in my head,
the world cannot be heard leaves obliterate
my heart, we touch each other
far apart…let us count
into

patron, it
hangs in the hall outside the bedroom
swaying hungrily like these
giant white goddesses of the dark grotto…there are touring cars
and men with large guns

of light, the two globes now two eyes in

“one must try behind the hills” eight great dahlias stood
beyond the mountains. they set fire to the sun

in the valley of vision. eight suns

﻿one comes to language from afar, the ear

solid, six-sided music…a few utterly quiet scenes, things

﻿john gordon boyd
died on the birthday
of three remarkable, and remarkably different, writers:
heinrich heine, kenneth patchen, ross mcdonald. 
john, too, was just as remarkable, blessed with an inherent “graciousness”
and with extraordinary eyes & ears…i think of two texts
on the grievous occasion of his death: “religion does not help me.
the faith that others give to what is unseen,
i give to what i can touch, and look at.
my gods dwell in temples
made with hands.”
— oscar wilde, in de profundis and two lines in rainier maria rilke,
john’s favorite poet,
that say it all…
was tun sie, gott,wenn ich bin stürbe? “what will you do,
god, when i am dead?”

their singer suffered breakdowns. in their work
there was a sense of what it was to live there at that time.
one song described the dark around the military
vehicles between them and the cocaine waiting
in gramercy. it was about the sepsis that followed love
or love repeated as farce, the neck neck neck
damaged by an anonymous hand unstringing guitars.
they got away with it and worked to abolish youth
by knitting and paying half-attention. i thought i was
in love because my sentiments were matched
by a generic, abiding sense of unfreedom. nothing
survives lovers descrying the red flags of old flames.
nothing is more relatable than an unreasonable person
operating subtractively, indulgently, out of exasperation.﻿

p. entered a third space
from which he could watch time pass
instead of walking to the monastery
in the middle of the night. his opaque sexuality derived from the absence
of a guarantee that his person would remain intact. he recognized this in himself
and we stared at the pylons regressing
into the lackluster northeastern woods. the monastery was a display
before which he claimed sangfroid
a picturesque ruin to which he was conveyed
as though by boreal fluid. everyone loved occasional works like this
their allusions to complementary and absent events. weaving around proliferating drywall
i despaired over this desire. 
p. joined the migrant workforce
and grew more disconsolate and distant
and drunk in our presence. our presence was only possible
because of advances in technology
in a dialectical relationship with their debasement:
servers in cold rooms
and a recursive void of woodblock chat sounds.

there should be a writing of non-writing. someday it will come. a brief writing, without grammar, a writing of words alone. words without supporting grammar. lost. written, there.
and immediately left behind.—marguerite duras (translated by mark pollizzotti) ﻿it came. words smashed out of the sky and from the mouths and off the pages and from the flesh and blood of the bodies and the words hit the readers and were destroyed like more bodies and the fields of the nation were littered with bodies and dead. carcass love, they called it. carcass economy, they called it. and the readers found the carcasses strewn across the pages and the readers came and stripped their innards and twirled intestines above their heads like lassos. the carcasses fell onto the pages and were taken away in wagons and trucks and they were replaced with new carcasses that were sold for words before the flies laid eggs and the wounds had time to fester. false carcass economy! will the souls of the carcasses miss themselves when they die? will the bodies whose lips slurp out the souls of the carcasses miss themselves when they die? will the words from the bodies who slurp out the souls of the carcasses cease to exist when the bodies themselves die? the readers grovel in the pages and find themselves in ditches with the carcasses but they do not know the rules of the false carcass economy. in this book the readers can feel their feet being removed. in this book the readers can feel the splash of the abattoir blood that sprinkles the page with poems. how do you know if the poems have too many bubbles? that is, how do you know if the blood of the poems has too many bubbles? when we speak of our own lives, says the collective voice of the readers, we certainly don’t mean human life. on the page the readers find themselves crawling around like quadrupeds with hands full of grass and earth uprooting plants and trees setting out for home and not getting far counting corpses on the fields to hell with animals there is god grinding his teeth with joy forging his way through the ruins of failing flesh there is the machine that has annihilated the bulk of humanity is it semen or is it a carburetor that makes us unrecognizable we know who we are through decay and in someone else’s story this is a lot worse than knocking your own brains out with good results then drinking tea with sugar and milk and suddenly feeling revived then exploding with words and speaking with animals and sinking in mud and being found by peasants who clean turds and who are like silent gods with holes in their shoes it is horrible to eat horrible to bulge in the belly with food horrible to blink when so many can’t blink oh to ruminate once more on the air polluted with liability on the hair singed from pollution the eyes burning fingers shrivelling the exact moment of ending will not come for many millennia we will not be able to document it it will document us it’s okay to kill some bodies speak of nothing and you’re lucky to make friends flank kidney liver swollen body on the sand who are you now that i am speaking with a mouth full of words that do not belong to me i crawl across the page and i don’t know if i’m dying or dead.

here the readers gather to watch the books die. they die suddenly, as if thrown from an airplane, or from spontaneous cardiac arrest. they live, and then suddenly they die, and the reader who watches this is at the moment of the books' death bombarded with images documented through the smiling lipstick face of a journalist who has shown up to report on the death of the books. the milk was poisoned and forty-two babies died, she laughs, as she fondles the ashes of the dead books. and the death of forty-two babies is equal in value to the death of this book which is equal in value to the ninety-year old woman who shot herself while the sheriff waited at her door with an eviction notice which is equal in value to the collapsing of the global economy which is equal to the military in country xyz seizing the land of the semi-nomadic hunters and cultivators of crops who have lived in the local rain forest for thousands of years. the reader opens a dead book and finds an infinite amount of burnt ash between the bindings, and when the ash blows in the wind the lipstick says that every death in the world is equal to every other death in the world which is equal to every birth in the world which is equal to every act of dismemberment which is equal to the death of a jungle which is equal to the collapse of the global economy; and hey look there’s another lady falling out of a window; she looks about equal to the poet hurled out of his country for words he wrote but which did not belong to him and whose death is about equal to the girl who was shot on the bus on her way to school this morning which is just about the same as the bearded man whose head was shoved into a sac while water was dumped over it and he died for an instant and came back to life and talked and talked and that’s about equal to the steroid illegally injected into the arm of a beautiful man who makes forty million dollars a year for injecting his arms with steroids so he can more skillfully wave a wooden stick at a ball, and in the ash we see the truest democracy there ever was: hey look it’s a little baby found in a dumpster how equal you are says the smiling lipstick to the civilized nation whose citizens walk the flooded streets looking for their homes, and in the ashes of the dead book the dead streets are equal to the eating disorders of movie stars which are equal to the dead soldiers who are equal to the homeruns which are equal to the bomb dropped by country abc over weddings in the village of country xyz which is equal to the earth swallowing up and devouring all of its foreigners which is just about equal to the decline in literacy in the most educated nation in the planet. there is no end to this book. there are no paragraph breaks to interrupt the smiling lipstick that goes on and on in one string of ashy words about how the declaration of peace is equal to the resumption of war and how the bodies that fall are equal to the birds that ascend and how the bomb in the eiffel tower is equal to the rising cost of natural gas, and the murmurs of the voices in the mud are equal to the murmurs of the expensive suits falling out of buildings and these are equal to the silence that kills with one breath and coddles life with another.

the burning girl grown woman
fire
mother of fire
i go to the stone street turning to fire.
voices
go screaming
fire
to the green glass wall.
and there where my youth flies blazing into fire
the
dance
of sane and insane images, noon
of seasons and days.
noontime of my one hour. saw down the bright noon street the crooked faces
among the tall daylight in the city of change.
the scene has walls
stone
glass
all my gone life
one wall a web through which the moment walks
and i am open, and the opened hour
the world as water-garden
lying behind it.
in a city of stone, necessity of fountains,
forces water fallen on glass, men with their axes.an arm of flame reaches from water-green glass,
behind the wall i know waterlilies
drinking their light, transforming light and our eyes
sky thrown under water, clouds under those flowers,
walls standing on all things stand in a city noon
who will not believe a waterlily fire.
whatever can happen in a city of stone,
whatever can come to a wall can come to this wall. i walk in the river of crisis toward the real,
i pass guards, finding the center of my fear
and you, dick, endlessly my friend during storm. the arm of flame striking through the wall of form.
the island born of this river and this rock island, i relate
the changes : i born when the whirling snow
rained past the general’s grave and the amiable child
white past the windows of the house of gyp the blood.
general, gangster, child.
i know in myself the island. i was the island without bridges, the child down whose blazing
eye the men of plumes and bone raced their canoes and fire
among the building of my young childhood, houses;
i was those changes, the live darknesses
of wood, the pale grain of a grove in the fields
over the river fronting red cliffs across—
and always surrounding her the river, birdcries, the wild
father building his sand, the mother in panic her parks—
bridges were thrown across, the girl arose
from sleeping streams of change in the change city.
the violent forgetting, the naked sides of darkness.
fountain of a city in growth, and island of light and water.
snow striking up past the graves, the yellow cry of spring. whatever can come to a city can come to this city.
under the tall compulsion
of the past
i see the city
change like a man changing
i love this man
with my lifelong body of love
i know you
among your changes
wherever i go
hearing the sounds of building
the syllables of wrecking
a young girl watching
the man throwing red hot rivets
coals in a bucket of change
how can you love a city that will not stay?
i love you
like a man of life in change. leaves like yesterday shed, the yellow of green spring
like today accepted and become one’s self
i go, i am a city with bridges and tunnels,
rock, cloud, ships, voices.
to the man where the river met
the tracks, now buried deep along the drive
where blossoms like sex pink, dense pink, rose, pink, red. towers falling.
a dream of towers.
necessity of fountains.
and my poor,
stirring among our dreams,
poor of my own spirit, and tribes, hope of towers
and lives, looking out through my eyes.
the city the growing body of our hate and love.
the root of the soul, and war in its black doorways.
a male sustained cry interrupting nightmare.
male flower heading upstream. among a city of light, the stone that grows.
stigma of dead stone, inert water, the tattered
monuments rivetted against flesh.
blue noon where the wall made big agonized men
stand like sailors pinned howling on their lines, and i
see stopped in time a crime behind green glass,
lilies of all my life on fire.
flash faith in a city building its fantasies. i walk past the guards into my city of change.
journey changes many of us
each in his own life waiting
waiting to move
beginning to move
walking
and early on the road of the hill of the world
come to my landscapes emerging on the grass
the stages of the theatre of the journey
i see the time of willingness between plays
waiting and walking and the play of the body
silver body with its bosses and places
one by one touched awakened into into
touched and turned one by one into
flame the theatre of the advancing goddess
blossoming
smiles as she stands intensely being in stillness
slowness in her blue dress advancing standing i go
and far across a field over the jewel grass
the play of the family stroke by stroke acted out 
gestures of deep acknowledging on the journey stages
of the playings the play of the goddess and the god
a supple god of searching and reaching
who weaves his strength
who dances her more alive the theatre of all animals, my snakes, my great horses always the journey
long
patient
many haltings
many waitings for choice and again easy breathing
when the decision to go on is made
along the long slopes of choice and again the world the play of poetry approaching in its solving solvings of relations in poems and silences
for we were born to express
born for a journey
caves, theatres, the companioned solitary way
and then i came to the place of mournful labor a turn in the road and the long sight from the cliff over the scene of the land dug away to nothing and many
seen to a stripped horizon carrying barrows of earth
a hod of earth taken and emptied and thrown away
repeated farther than sight.
the voice saying slowly but it is hell.
i heard my own voice in the words
or it could be a foundation
and after the words
my chance came.
to enter.
the theatres of the world.
fragile i think of the image brought into my room
of the sage and the thin young man who flickers and asks.
he is asking about the moment when the buddha
offers the lotus, a flower held out as declaration.
“isn’t that fragile?” he asks.
the sage answers:
“i speak to you.
you speak to me.
is that fragile?”
the long body this journey is exploring us. where the child stood
an island in a river of crisis, now
the bridges bind us in symbol, the sea
is a bond, the sky reaches into our bodies.
we pray : we dive into each other’s eyes. whatever can come to a woman can come to me. this is the long body : into life from the beginning,
big-headed infant unfolding into child, who stretches and finds
and then flowing the young one going tall, sunward,
and now full-grown, held, tense, setting feet to the ground,
going as we go in the changes of the body,
as it is changes, in the long strip of our many
shapes, as we range shifting through time.
the long body : a procession of images.
this moment in a city, in its dream of war.
we chose to be,
becoming the only ones under the trees
when the harsh sound
of the machine sirens spoke. there were these two men,
and the bearded one, the boys, the negro mother feeding
her baby. and threats, the ambulance with open doors.
now silence. everyone else within the walls. we sang.
we are the living island,
we the flesh of this island, being lived,
whoever knows us is part of us today.
whatever can happen to anyone can happen to me.
fire striking its word among us, waterlilies
reaching from darkness upward to a sun
of rebirth, the implacable.
and in our myth
the changing woman who is still and who offers.
eyes drinking light, transforming light, this day
that struggles with itself, brings itself to birth.
in ways of being, through silence, sources of light
arriving behind my eye, a dialogue of light.
and everything a witness of the buried life.
this moment flowing across the sun, this force
of flowers and voices body in body through space.
the city of endless cycles of the sun. i speak to you
you speak to me

alexander sailing was from his true course turned
by a young wind from a cloud in asia moving
like a most recognizable most silvery woman;
tall alexander to the island came.
the small breeze blew behind his turning head.
he walked the foam of ripples into this scene.
the trunk of the speaking tree looks like a tree-trunk
until you look again.
then people and animals
are ripening on the branches;
the broad leaves
are leaves;
pale horses, sharp fine foxes
blossom;
the red rabbit falls
ready and running.
the trunk coils, turns,
snakes, fishes.
now the ripe people fall and run,
three of them in their shore-dance, flames that stand
where reeds are creatures and the foam is flame.
stiff alexander stands.
he cannot turn.
but he is free to turn : this is the speaking tree,
it calls your name.
it tells us what we mean.

the way out the night is covered with signs. the body and face of man,
with signs, and his journeys.
where the rock is split
and speaks to the water;
the flame speaks to the cloud;
the red splatter, abstraction, on the door
speaks to the angel and the constellations.
the grains of sand on the sea-floor speak at last to the noon.
and the loud hammering of the land behind
speaks ringing up the bones of our thighs, the hoofs,
we hear the hoofs over the seethe of the sea.
all night down the centuries, have heard, music of passage.
music of one child carried into the desert;
firstborn forbidden by law of the pyramid.
drawn through the water with the water-drawn people
led by the water-drawn man to the smoke mountain.
the voice of the world speaking, the world covered by signs,
the burning, the loving, the speaking, the opening.
strong throat of sound from the smoking mountain.
still flame, the spoken singing of a young child.
the meaning beginning to move, which is the song.
music of those who have walked out of slavery.
into that journey where all things speak to all things
refusing to accept the curse, and taking
for signs the signs of all things, the world, the body
which is part of the soul, and speaks to the world,
all creation being created in one image, creation.
this is not the past walking into the future,
the walk is painful, into the present, the dance
not visible as dance until much later.
these dancers are discoverers of god.
we knew we had all crossed over when we heard the song.
out of a life of building lack on lack:
the slaves refusing slavery, escaping into faith:
an army who came to the ocean: the walkers
who walked through the opposites, from i to opened thou,
city and cleave of the sea. those at flaming nauvoo,
the ice on the great river: the escaping negroes,
swamp and wild city: the shivering children of paris
and the glass black hearses; those on the long march:
all those who together are the frontier, forehead of man.
where the wilderness enters, the world, the song of the world.
akiba rescued, secretly, in the clothes of death
by his disciples carried from jerusalem
in blackness journeying to find his journey
to whatever he was loving with his life.
the wilderness journey through which we move
under the whirlwind truth into the new,
the only accurate. a cluster of lights at night:
faces before the pillar of fire. a child watching
while the sea breaks open. this night. the way in.
barbarian music, a new song.
acknowledging opened water, possibility:
open like a woman to this meaning.
in a time of building statues of the stars,
valuing certain partial ferocious skills
while past us the chill and immense wilderness
spreads its one-color wings until we know
rock, water, flame, cloud, or the floor of the sea,
the world is a sign, a way of speaking. to find.
what shall we find? energies, rhythms, journey.
ways to discover. the song of the way in.

murmurs from the earth of this land, from the caves and craters,
from the bowl of darkness. down watercourses of our
dragon childhood, where we ran barefoot.
we stand as growing women and men. murmurs come down
where water has not run for sixty years.
murmurs from the tulip tree and the catalpa, from the ax of
the stars, from the house on fire, ringing of glass; from
the abandoned iron-black mill.
stars with voices crying like mountain lions over forgotten
colors.
blue directions and a horizon, milky around the cities where the
murmurs are deep enough to penetrate deep rock.
trapping the lightning-bird, trapping the red central roots.
you know the murmurs. they come from your own throat.
you are the bridges to the city and the blazing food-plant green;
the sun of plants speaks in your voice, and the infinite shells of
accretions
a beach of dream before the smoking mirror.
you are close to that surf, and the leaves heated by noon, and
the star-ax, the miner’s glitter walls. the crests of the sea
are the same strength you wake with, the darkness is the eyes
of children forming for a blaze of sight and soon, soon,
everywhere your own silence, who drink from the crater, the
nebula, one another, the changes of the soul.

deeper than sleep but not so deep as death
i lay there dreaming and my magic head
remembered and forgot. on first cry i
remembered and forgot and did believe.
i knew love and i knew evil:
woke to the burning song and the tree burning blind,
despair of our days and the calm milk-giver who
knows sleep, knows growth, the sex of fire and grass,
renewal of all waters and the time of the stars
and the black snake with gold bones. black sleeps, gold burns; on second cry i woke
fully and gave to feed and fed on feeding.
gold seed, green pain, my wizards in the earth
walked through the house, black in the morning dark.
shadows grew in my veins, my bright belief,
my head of dreams deeper than night and sleep.
voices of all black animals crying to drink,
cries of all birth arise, simple as we,
found in the leaves, in clouds and dark, in dream,
deep as this hour, ready again to sleep.

my liveliest self, i give you fair leave
in these windblown weathers,
heather-hearted and human and strange,
to turn every blackberry corner
of yesterday’s summer. the robin, singing her love-me-forever,
kiss-catch-clutch-in the heather
blues, sings tide flow
and autumn’s turning and white
winds folding. cattle along all hedges wind winter
into their frosty
breathing, their slow eyes dreaming
barn, bullock, and fodder
under all hedges. but sea cave and sycamore tell us the world
is wider than weather.
blackberries darken the corners

at dusk, a great flare of winter lightning photographed the bay:
waves were broken scrolls. beyond donegal, white mountains
hung in a narrow bas-relief frozen on sky. later, there was sleet: trees down
on the drumholm road; near timoney’s farm, a frantic goose
pinned under branches. all night long, we spoke of loneliness,
long winter, while winter sang in the chimneys. then the sky cleared and a marvel began: the hills turned blue;
in the valley a blue cottage sent up the day’s first plume of smoke.
it gathered like a dream drenched in frost. that should have been all.
we had worn out night.
but single-file, deliberate, five heifers, a black bull, three calves stepped through the
broken fence.
they arranged themselves between the house and hedge: a kind of diagram:
a shifting pattern grazing frozen weeds.
their image is with me still.
the backs of the cattle are patchy with frost blue as
morning.

the giant takes us
down. a man with no arms.
unbreakable. what made today
is concordant,
transforms
the brief decisive phase we call fear .i look to that whited-over part and see a face.
then i look to the black and
see the same face.
there were tunnels…chambers beneath some of the sidewalks…page after page of places… 
the last thing you think of.
won’t be my fluffy blonde hair. we have his ear.
he was the first boy i knew. the liberation.
which i remember
from sand. the pail shape. the whole world’s washed out. these words: take refuge.
what i mean by dream in this case is
his last dream.
and you see no land, you’re that far away. someone coughs
in my first life.
someone must have noticed
how like you he is…first you can’t be heard
then you can’t hear
then you can’t dial
then you can’t turn it off
you pose a question, i repeat it. and as always with speech, one is blind.as a reflector, as of cloth or
thick flecked glass, as slats—
you asked though about the self.
there were fireflies,
and the corn cut to the nubs. the windows
shook, we saw a flash of light…then the tiniest
feckles
of rain after we waited
all day.

she considers a field. she considers a field and buys it. let her have the fruit of her hands. we come down from the mountains. yellow trees, green trees. i was leaving earth but, before i did, i had to get rid of all my animals. my main one, my main model for behavior, was my snake. he was attached to the bottom of my foot but had become dangerous seeming and i was afraid he would bite me if he got the chance. my sister was there and i said, “before i leave, i have to get rid of all my animals,” thinking maybe she’d help me. i said, “my horse, my frog, my snake…” but didn’t mention i was worried about how to dislodge my snake safely. as i was waking up, i thought of going to a place where they could give the snake a shot to knock it out or even kill it before they tried to get it off my foot. which seemed like a pretty good idea, though inconvenient.

made an acquaintance

among free newspaper boxes
he removed his domino. what to construe

the impossibility of translation
from a phone booth to a churchyard a gate painted white
a belfry with no bell
some culture with haceks
the sense of lolling in a park from a churchyard to a community garden
heckling the rooster as it crowed. we left the part we liked
jeering the rooster from a sward. we reentered the garden with a script
but refused to expand on the vestiges of happiness. 
a girl took responsibility for the garden
and plied us with background information
until her nervous guardian sent us back to the church
with a coat of arms where we were going anyway
as though under the influence of boreal fluid.
the songbirds of the yard
were about to be contaminated
by a new age concert.
with so little at stake
they praised positive thinking.﻿

﻿in light room in dark hell in umber in chrome,
i sit feeling the swell of the cloud made about by movement 
of arm leg and tongue. in reflections of gold
light. tints and flashes of gold and amber spearing
and glinting. blur glass…blue glass, black telephone. match flame of violet and flesh
seen in the clear bright light. it is not night and night too. in hell, there are stars outside.
and long sounds of cars. brown shadows on walls
in the light
of the room. i sit or stand wanting the huge reality of touch and love.
in the turned room. remember the long-ago dream of stuffed animals (owl, fox) in a dark shop. wanting
only the purity of clean colors and new shapes
and feelings.
i would cry for them uselessly i have ten years left to worship my youth
billy the kid, rimbaud, jean harlow
in dark hell in light room in umber and chrome i
feel the swell of
smoke the drain and flow of motion of exhaustion, the long sounds of cars
the brown shadows
on the wall. i sit or stand. caught in the net of glints from corner table to
dull plane
from knob to floor, angles of flat light, daggers of beams. staring at love’s face.
the telephone in cataleptic light. march flames of blue and red seen in the
clear grain.
i see myself—ourselves—in hell without radiance. reflections that we are. the long cars make sounds and brown shadows over the wall. i am real as you are real whom i speak to.
i raise my head, see over the edge of my nose. look up and see that nothing is changed. there is no flash
to my eyes. no change to the room.
vita nuova—no! the dead, dead world.
the strain of desire is only a heroic gesture.
an agony to be so in pain without release when love is a word or kiss.

all huge like giant flightless kiwis twice the
size of ostriches,
they turned and walked away from us
and you were there jane and you were twenty-two
but this was the nineteen-forties,
in wichita, near the edge of town, in a field
surrounded by a copse of cottonwoods. it was
getting dark and the trees around the bridge
almost glowed like a scene by palmer.
the two giant birds—aepyorni—from madagascar,
extincted a.d. one thousand, turned and walked
from us across the bridge. even in the semi-darkness
the softness of their brown feathers made
curls pliant as a young mother’s hair. there
was a sweet submission in the power of their enormous
legs (giant drumsticks). their tiny heads
(in proportion to their bodies) were bent
utterly submerged in their business and sweeping
side to side as a salmon does—or as a wolf does—
but with a pleistocene, self-involved gentleness
beyond our ken. my heart rose in my chest
(as the metaphysical poets say “with
purple wings of joy.”) to see them back
in life again. we both looked, holding hands,
and i felt your wide-eyed drinking-inof things.
then i turned and viewed across the darkening
field and there was a huge flightless hunting fowl
(the kind that ate mammals in the pliocene).
he stood on one leg in the setting sun by the sparkling
stream that cut across the meadow to the bridge.
he had a hammer head and curled beak, and after my
initial surge of fear to see the field was dotted,
populated, by his brethren, each standing in the setting sun, i saw their stately nobility and again the self-involvement. we followed the aepyorni across the old wooden bridge made of huge
timbers. the bridge was dark from the shadows
of the poplars and the evergreens there.
the stream was dimpled with flashing moonlight—and i think it had a little song.
then i found that on the bridge we were among
a herd of black wildebeests—black gnus.
one was two feet away—turned toward me—
looking me eye-into-eye. there was primal
wildness in the upstanding coarse (not
sleek as it really is in africa) fur on
the knobby, powerful-like-buffalo shoulders.
(remember this is a dream.) i passed by him
both afraid and unafraid of wildness as i had passed
through the herd of zebras at the top of ngorongoro crater
in front of the lodge, where from the cliff we could see
a herd of elephants like ants, and the soda lake
looked pink because of flamingos there.
there is an essence in fear overcome
and i overcame fright in passing those zebrasand this black wildebeest.
then we passed over the heavy bridge and down a little trail
on the far side of the meadow, walking back in the direction we had been. soon we came to a cottage of white clapboards
behind a big white clapboard house and knocked
on the door; it was answered by a young man
with long hair who was from the incredible string band.
he took us inside and he played an instrument
like a guitar and he danced as he played it.
the lyre-guitar was covered with square plastic
buttons in rows of given sizes and shapes.
the instrument would make any sound, play
any blues, make any creature sound, play
any melody…i wanted it
badly—it was a joy. my chest rose.
i figured i’d have to, and would be glad to,
give twenty or thirty thousand for it…
then the dream broke
and i was standing somewhere with joanna
to the side of a crowd of people by a wall
of masonry and i reached into my mouth
and took from my jaw (all the other
persons vanished and i was the center of everything)
a piece which was eight teeth
fused together. i stared at them
wondering how they could all be one piece.
they were white…it was some new fossil.
down on the bone there were indentations like rivulets
like the flowing patterns of little rivers.

the mind drifts through
in the shape of a museum,
in the guise of a museum
dreaming dead friends:
jim, tom, emmet, bill.
—like billboards their huge faces droop
and stretch on the walls,
on the walls of the cliffs out there,
where trees with white trunks
makes plumes on rock ridges.my mind is fingers holding a pen. trees with white trunks
make plumes on rock ridges.
rivers of sand are memories.
memories make movies
on the dust of the desert.
hawks with pale bellies
perch on the cactus,

the unsettling state of creation and how we have damaged—
isn’t one a suitable lens through which to see another:
filter the body, filter the mind, filter the resilient land and by resilient i mean which holds
which tolerates the inconstant lover, the pitiful treatment
the experiment, the untried & untrue, the last stab at wellness choose your own adventure: drug failure or organ failure
cataclysmic climate change
or something akin to what’s killing bees—colony collapse more like us than we’d allow, this wondrous swatch of rough why do i need to say the toads and moor and clouds—﻿
in a spring of misunderstanding, i took the cricket’s sound and delight i took in the sex of every season, the tumble on moss
the loud company of musicians, the shy young bookseller
anonymous voices that beckoned to ramble
to be picked from the crepuscule at the forest’s edge until the nocturnal animals crept forth
their eyes like the lamps in store windows
forgotten, vaguely firing a desire for home hence, the body’s burden, its resolute campaign: trudge on and if the war does not shake us from our quietude, nothing will i carry the same baffled heart i have always carried
a bit more battered than before, a bit less joy
for i see the difficult charge of living in this declining sphere by the open air, i swore out my list of pleasures:
sprig of lilac, scent of pine
the sparrows bathing in the drainage ditch, their song the lusty thoughts in spring as the yellow violets bloom
and the cherry forms its first full buds
the tonic cords along the legs and arms of youth
and youth passing into maturity, ripening its flesh
growing softer, less unattainable, ruddy and spotted plum daily, i mistake—there was a medication i forgot to take
there was a man who gave himself, decently, to me & i refused him in a protracted stillness, i saw that heron i didn’t wish to disturb
was clearly a white sack caught in the redbud’s limbs i did not comprehend desire as a deadly force until—
daylight, don’t leave me now, i haven’t done with you—
nor that, in this late hour, we still cannot make peace if i, inconsequential being that i am, forsake all others
how many others correspondingly forsake this world light, light: do not go

no hostility.
it is a taste we want most to subdue. it asks
to be left alone.
we use it with fish and tea. we sugar it. look out the window. it stands with a donkey’s
stance, hoping the day will pass.
its scent through the curtains
cuts through
mustiness, sharp
with sweet blossoms. it hides the smell
of new babies.

 a hole torn in the fabric of the world,
the web, the whole infernal weave
through which life-giving rain is falling
but mixing with the tears and with the blood.
dead body-snatchers enter, the mega-corpses,
much in the news these days, enter and grind
bones, flesh and sinews down to dry tree bark,
mixing with tree bark, crawling with the demonic
beetles. they’ll tell it later: “no one expected this”:
not one—patient, doctors, practitioners
of every stripe, no one except the one whose daily
work is close to prophecy, who feels it in his nerves
or in her muscles—where news travels up fast
and lodges in the eyes, all-seeing, all-pervading vision
of disaster. and comes in like a mouse, wee small,
[wee modest, so wee, wee practical,] mouse with big ears
and popping eyes, looking this way and that and not
one tittle-tattle fazed by your huge presence. later
drowns in a bucket with a lizard: everything drowns
round here getting to water. not able to get out again.
thus coming quietly, thus probing, [thus stealing in,]
squatting thus quietly back of the house:
how do the tears well up, well down again,
what makes them well, the seeing eyes know not,
what routes the change parent-to-orphan? stop.
orphan-to-parent? stop. then back again to tears?
look out beyond the healthy trees preserved
in a close circle round the house for privacy,
look out the window over hills and dales
of this milagro country, see living green, see dying
brown—on each and every morning mourn the trees.
criminal imbeciles who run the shows we live in
from top to bottom of their slimy theater, have now
decreed they will not solve the water. matter of fact,
they will not solve what we are made of—the high
percentage water in all of us compounded. they will not
solve a single problem by the name of life we give
to human business. they will prefer
to dip their steel in blood, to let the semen drip
from off of their steel into the blood and thus contaminate,
infuse with every cancer both body politic and body
not so politic, just private, single, individual—but
gives to other individuals their mien and color. ghosts
walk the hills and dales between the dying trees.
“remember now,” they say, with stab at tragic countenance,
[for when can privacy enter into collective?] “those days,
those days you took no notice of, counting them poor,
dispersing them among the memories you could not value
at their true worth, you could not recognize enough to feel:
who knows if these few days, [these very days], were not
those ones we lived together here, the only paradise?”

at five, the market is closing. burdock roots, parsley, and rutabagas are poured back into the trucks. the antique dealer breaks down his tables. light dappled, in winter parkas shoppers hunt for bargains: a teapot, or costume jewelry, a grab bag of rubbishy vegetables for stew. now twilight, the farmer’s wife bundled in her tweed coat and pocket apron counts out her cash from a metal box, and nods to her grown-up son back from a tour in iraq, as he waits in the station wagon with the country music turned way up, his prosthetic leg gunning the engine.

on steppe or veld or pampas dry,

petrarch dreams of pebbles
on the tongue, he loves me
at a distance, black polished stone
skipping the lake that swallows
worn-down words, a kind of drown
and drench and quench and very kind
to what i would've said. light marries
water and what else (unfit
for drinking purposes), light lavishes
my skin on intermittent sun. (i am weather
and unreasonable, out of all
season. petrarch loves my lies
of laurel leaves, ripped sprigs of
deciduous evergreen.) a creek is lying
in my cement-walled bed, slurring
through the center of small
town; the current's brown and
turbid (muddy, turbulent
with recent torrents), silt rushing
toward the reservoir. a sonata
passes by too close (i have to jump)
and yes i do hear music here. it's blue, or
turquoise, aquamarine, some synonym
on wheels, note down that note. it's petrarch
singing with his back to me (delivering
himself to voice), his fingers
filled with jonquil, daffodils, mistaken
narcissus. (i surprised him
between the pages of a book,
looked up the flowers i misnamed.)
forsythia and magnolia bring me
spring, when he walks into the house
he has wings. song is a temporary thing
(attempt), he wants to own his music.

no one knew what the stones like squatting frogs
signified. there they were, fuming in rows, out
of the ground; every critic had his explanation
or hers. but—we had to remember—they came to nothing, every one; those large stones
out of the earth served the systems
of those who considered them, as explaining
something about the past it was important for the explainer to explain. and yet
no one had any idea truly; there was no
basis in fact for any view of them, and
they remained like their origins—or like smiling olmec babies, sweet but ominous figures
come from the earth to reproach us, almost
cheerfully, for our ignorance—a mystery, just
as the probe of our feelings came up with nothing.

light from the ugliest lamp i ever saw, here
on the table that triples for reading, eating (can’t say
dining), business on the phone; ugliest except
a few around the corner in that guest house at windows—plaster driftwood; cylinders like rockets or sanitary
napkins propping shades; thin torso of a youth;
red globe on orange globe, the works, somebody’s
collection. wouldn’t she love this one, lump of lamp base intending landscape, two donkeys in mustard glaze,
heads ruefully down, one carrying two rush panniers
large enough to hold your pens or salts and peppers; on
the other a shifty man with droopy moustache rides,**grumping under his sombrero; right leg broken
off at the knee, left leg clipped at ankle. they make
no progress, this mold-made work—the joins, arthritic
ridges where dabs of grayish green suggest a wizened bush from which a brass post rises
to hold a shade that doesn’t fit and twice
has tried to burn, as crusty sores at the rim show.
still, it lights my work. why hate it? do i care?
these indecorous furnishings stand for failure, are
a clutter that weighs down, defeats the purpose,
like dumbbells taken along on vacations; the pen jar;
lamp base, sextant, portable folding triptych.**the writing table fills with clutter. specials
coax me to nudge buying into play. a checkout
coupon lets me get some brand of lunch meats
fifty-five cents off if i spend two dollars
but i just can’t find it when i’m shopping, the ticket—
with its rubric of good news and inscrutable forest
of bar code, black on red—to lead me on; back home
there it is, on the table, laying waste my power to spend.
what i have wanted (with larkin) to do must be
“essentially undoable, it belongs to the imagination.”
rather, the demolition has begun, piss and shit
and blood mix in the snow-white bowl; and yet**i find the beech forest (behind the beach
dunes) that allen recommended “without
reservation.” the man was right—it more
than satisfies, these beech ponds and their duneforest. i sat on a pitch pine that had blown
over and then turned round and risen again,
and bowed part making a seat something like
a saddle; the tree was growing while i sat on it
as were the other pitch pines round the pond ruddy
in afternoon, late light of day, rough trunks
with tufts of twisted branches green with needles,
it was idyllic, wind speaking through the pines,
solitude:—o, yes, two high-breasted girls
came striding by, i heard them coming, i
heard them going, yammering at full volume
not looking left or right, they passed me, were
out of sight and soon of earshot, doppler effect
caused by exuberant youth in oblivious chitchat.
and people are smoking in these dry woods too,
not policing their butts is how i know, 
the butts will surface from the heavier, sifting sand,
sand spilling, surfing down hills, crashing in waves
over the path here. but call it solitude,
when a thought—but wait! i thought—i should not be
having a thought here, this moment: yet a vision
of a chinese poet in his study overlooking
such a pond as this arrives out of the silence
like the yellow water lilies on the water, pads spreading out in files like a design on the broadloom
of a lobby. the sage is working on a poem, brushing it
on silk, inspired by a blend of tao and
confucius. doubtless he would not forget allusions to sung poets, if he were not
a sung poet himself, in which case he would have to
echo han or t’ang; and he would be writing
of solitude; time passing; absent friends
(enlightenment would have to be inferred).
no matter, i didn’t bring a pen today.
however, over there are inkberry bushes, so
with a reed i just might make a start. . . . farther on the path i listen to a bird, a warbler perhaps,
i do not know the song or see the bird.
there with the pines and sand and birdsong, and no
prayer- or guide- or selfhelp-book, no serious commune, the mind must yearn to be
led on; it wants a deity, an altar to approach;
an altar at least to take steps toward; occasion
to rise to—with nothing planned for the mind,
it’s like a person suddenly blind, not blind
for a long time and knowing the ropes, but just
now, rope-stung, blind—and groping, feeling around
for the way, any way, or, closer to home, 
when the power goes at night just getting from
here to there even though you know the drill,
—you never find the batteries when you need them,
groping down cellar for the circuit breaker then 
you flip it; nothing, it’s a bigger failure you are part of—
know the layout in general yet without ceremony
the mind leans forward, over an edge, hoping for,
needing a little ritual, like a guide rail to keep it
from falling, going down. even then the mind
finds need of other news, keeps on desiring
alterity somewhere at hand. for example,
walking the streets of provincetown, nothing to see 
but lots to look at, all that fluff and buff,
the michelin-man day-trippers aching along;
suddenly i want a prayer book, maybe not bottles and stools or the little red book but still . . even a pocket copy of a shropshire lad,
such as i find soon after all the buff and fluff
at tim’s, the only bookstore on the street,
handy for quick reads. thin as a shortbread biscuit,
the richards press london 1915, no doubt
with its khaki cover, intended for some tommy’s
backpack, a backward solace for off-duty hours
in the trenches: admittedly not very muc hon the other hand just the thing i’m talking after;
a talisman perhaps is all, an amulet
with words that say, buck up, come on, you’ll make it, there’s something on after all this, no matter what the words say. housman’s “vision,” his drear
anguish of love for someone, something, lad
and landscape that never were, that might shoot threads
of gold among the bloody muslins and the mud;
mind wants other news than what the ruffled senses
bring data of—smoke or flesh or birdsong.
it saw there was a space within, reserved
for turning toward another; other; that no bullet, arrowwood or beach plum might
fill, though these could occupy that space
a moment.
again i heard the casual chirping
of that bird, off in that tupelo, the song i did not know, below the cries of gull
and jay i did. the unknown i saw was not
enough to satisfy; or—satisfied when it
was framed, complement of what is known for sure.
it’s—like—when you go someplace strange, new,
the seashore, any boundary, you want to learn the names
of plants. start looking at the edges of leaves. it gives
a grip on where you are, and who, or seems to,
to know bullbrier, bearberry, blueberry. you get a guide
or a local to tell. on the dune path i found one, a gnarled
bush alone, hollylike but succulent leaf; nothing
like it in the book. but why feel helped in nature by a name? when a horde of flower children wanted
to know what they should do to be saved (back when)
snyder told them, “learn the names of plants;
of animals; learn to do something with your hands.”
well i went out to that dune again: to cop a copy
of the leaf i took and lost: so it’s only bayberry
after all; dioecious, two-sexed: some leaves different
from others, that’s ok only one got pictured
in my book; but the waxiness, bayberry for sure, set
to be rendered into candles for a gifte shoppe,
nauseating noose of “scents.” its nutlets twinkle
near the oily leaves aglow above the sand,
bone white. doesn’t make me feel better to know now
about that scrawny straggler. sanctimonious
pilgrim know-alls, bradford & co.! forest
into desert, just like that. no time flat, considering.

that bag you packed me
when you sent me
to the universe—
camp after camp i’ve opened it
debating whether to unpack—
not yet, not yet—
why did i feel so much in it
was dangerous on the playground,
too good for everyday,
feel those splendid fireworks
hazardous to institutions,
unmannerly to etiquette,
so that, time after time,
i found myself saying
not yet? at each new place i faced it,
it suggested,
here spread out your things,
put on this coat,
open this bottle—
no, not yet . . .
sometimes throwing something out,
giving things away,
lightening my load. . . .the more i pull out,
the more it seems, some days,
is left inside,
the heavier it is. sometimes i think this package
is almost a door
the opening of which
careening across heaven
could be fatal. some days now i wonder if i’ll ever
dare face my given garments—
permanently wrinkled,
surely out of date—
your travel-thought
wasting in its tissue, flesh-corrupt—
till i’ve absorbed it,
like those stitches that dissolve
in an incision
where something’s been removed.

we each meet the day in our own way.
the aquarium with three unspent goldfish buzzes.
three flies are flying.
coffee, traceable to dark, wet trees in central america, cools.
the black cat on my lap hates poetry, even the sound of it being typed.
my skull and the falling stars sing back and forth the songs of magnets
in heat.
a car with a broken muffler hums along, mumbling answers to questions
i haven’t shaped yet.
what is a life?
stacks of typing paper wait to be darkened, dented.
on my white wall a photograph of the poet james galvin
(cut out from the american poetry review).
sometimes i want to be: 1. an american
2. a poet
3. reviewed 
james looks like a farmboy (iowa, iowa, you have more poets than
scarecrows these fuse-lit days).
how carelessly james sits back on his hips, staring into the camera’s eye.
(imprisoned inside there is the last surviving cyclops),
and i think of w. c. w.’s lines: the beauty of / terrible faces. when my face opens like james’s, it is a year later, years later.
some life is gone.
only poems remain.
perhaps a poem that a magazine wanted to publish before it folded
(“folded,” the flight of such a word).
and so the poem is stuck on a roll without a player piano.
imagination insists on saving its works as a poem, a tattoo, a quilt, an
essay, or an aside, like this one: love’s chilly night an angel’s cold hand
irons leaves into
this flat romance colors distract us
from stems rotting
under our own feet an angel burdens
our night with
its little laughs as a derisive white
moon freezes
far from a fire even as i type this my coffee is cold; the peasants who picked the beans are
sleeping; bottles of erasing fluids await their inevitable moments.
i lose this moment.
i’m dancing in the rain with a witch from san carlos: botta—is it you?
her red skirt turns like one solid year of sunsets.
i almost catch her, but i’m back to this moment.
just in time to send you, my friends, another telegram.
here, wordsworth’s worthy words.(i know i will have to bear their cost.)cling (stop) together (stop) in (stop)one (stop) society (stop)rane (stop)but the words won’t stop and what do i owe? on my desk: a dictionary.
all mine, my mine. words like “lacrimator” wait for me,
lak re mat ar
which means:1. the lake really matters
2. the lilac reddens into matters of the air
3. the lack of the red mats in the atticyes!
all of the above and below. one of the flies has landed on a photograph of me hiding behind
japanese fans.
i stare at the fly staring at the me who no longer exists.
i will not exist soon.
i’m here, behind the typewriter.
men don’t split into new personae at the command of flashes. we can become fleshless though, like the skeletons in mexican
cathedrals, guardians of empty confessionals.
in my room, i stare into a smaller box: “a brooding young man embraces
a golden girl whose blue dress has the words ‘forget xanadu’
stitched into it while dice without numbers float in the air suspended
between a far heaven and a near eart has a black spider crawls toward
the blind moon. a gray feather’s sleep on a blackening hill is
a hint of uncompleted journeys” my neighbor comes home on his slow, red motorcycle and enters this
poem again.
the miles hum between his legs.one of the flies has bitten me.
the black cat darkens all the windows by jumping sill to sill.
the goldfish haven’t lost their glitter.
at last, this is my land.
i’ve learned to speak its language:

in one version you must convince every living thing one by one
to weep until he climbs back into the marriage-house,
that earth about which it is said that bread is the glue of the earth.
certainly glue is money, the phrase “the tears of things” is money,
the revelation of the woman clothed in the sun is money.
the lake is a disc of bright money buying a few plain birds down,
they climb back nervously as you hurry through, plain birds like a
plain song,
that moment when four or five are around your knees
like zeno’s arrow, rising by halves, like eurydice’s bread,
& still the possibility they might intersect,
you would be the one who was struck by a flying bird,
somewhere between a blesséd fool & village idiot,
the only one to persist outside the local economy,
drooling at travelers, holding yourself, slinging incomprehensible

kinked plot

back of the church the busy forsythias bow
and scrape to may and all these blessed stones
stiff in their careful finery of words;
the mess of markers makes me go and browse.
somehow the blocks of slate and marble hate
to be cut and carved to the dimensions
of mary monday’s age and her virtues.
at heart they hurt to be made literate
and they are rebelling, fast as they can,
shedding an edge, a letter, as they go
—a year, a part of a skull, a bone—
it hurts them to stand so long for this
kind of death not theirs. fast as they can
they are leaning away from their duty
and look down longing for the warm sod.
the prides and fears they stand witness to,
the ladies and gents, are only whimsy now.
they cease to reflect that wary pride
the flesh beneath them took in lying down.
to the last date line and death’s-head-stare,
the legend reads, “there! i’ve done it!”
but these are only beginning,
the blocks of shale forget their lines
letting the sunlight and rain divide
and subdivide their veins and bone.
they do not care, they only feel
an unnatural heaviness, tottering so
in the hot light. they long to be off and away,
they toss and jibe in the sun;
a whole regatta of black sails, they are sailing away
over the lumpy green yard of time, and never
coming about for home until they capsize
turned turtle by boys from central square.
tired of holding—they are tired of holding up;
their always-leaning makes me hold my tongue
and sit with them awhile. we heave
our shoulders, or our shadows, on the mounds,
while under the hills, memorials more fine
lie lip to paper lip
and keep their impossible word.

sewn straw, exact pattern. fields of rice-sprigs
evenly set, a mile of herringbone tweed.
the town, a sea of gunmetal, fish-scale tiles.by morning each floor a casserole of pillows,
coverlets, comforters, towels:
flown nests. imprint

all day the bodies
circle, leaving no impression on each

school-caps, factory-packed subway, miracle train:

on his platform one yard square

after the declaration by emperor
to stop the war
many people in tokyo killed themselves,
for instance, in front of the imperial palace.
but few people knows those facts. hence you must teach me
where you got the news or what sort of book
gave you the fact that quite few people knows.
to know the fact of our nation’s subjection
is not so comfortable
but the fact of many people’s spontaneous death
gives me more complicated feelings. in the matter of what william gass said
i must describe my feelings. i went
to nagasaki
on an educational trip four years ago.
i can recollect those serious moment
which was given by the beamed materials
in the memorial hall. but most youth after the war
are indifferent to those
nightmares
because of our no experience. surely,
i think, those barbarious conducts
shouldn’t be forgiven or forgotten at all
and we must not close our eyes
to the rebombing
at any place
in this world.in conclusion i may say that most people
except sufferers
or the like
will not have ill feelings toward your country
but they will reproach
the suffocative fact
in history. where were you when the world war ii was over.
please share your experience of the war with me.
i’m now interested in the wars concerned with japan
for the past 100 years. if you tell me your reflections
i can suspect more seriously.
you have abandoned such cursed things as useless?
in that war 3 million people were killed
on the side of our nation, especially
three hundred thousand people by the a-bomb.
over the war between the imperialism
and militarism america won a victory.
what does this word mean?

minnesota, may 1945
dmz, september 19671in tokyo our gallant boys
dance rock-and-roll, squint eyes
wary at standing easy. they leer and reel
on a springboard tip and then
jackknife toward the electronic noise . . .and charley, when time inc. said he said
the president had his head
wedged about vietnam
burning for honor or—who knows?
the action he had said—
married the marines.
he showered for vows on those
who took his word who taught him
shoot it out and shout “yes sir yes sir!”
and sent him out like napalm
obedient to any itchy finger.
i hope the fields of minnesota gave perspective
when he moved out
as to the starting line
on the command, survive, survive.. . . our juiced doughboys feel their girls.2what
did i tell you
when we met
last and it “after the leeches and the food”
on a break
in the rain
was already up with you, charley?
mouthing the big cigar
like a gangster at the wheel . . .cigarette between thumb and finger
the way we all even in junior high
learned not to
your men watching in wonder
him tasting the strange
(turned officer so young)
foreign taste
that smoke:
and all was dark
except what sparks
he scattered there, stubbing it out\
what could we do for you
you hugging your knees who taught you
to raise your voice?3no more the wide mankato pearled with ice
under blue january sky
your arm around the shoulder of the friend who ran faster
no more the long hours pad in hand composing
reasons for your belief
a belief in fathers has no reason
no more the simple passion of going first
your hatless straightness, the struggle, the deep worry,
the dark africa of being alive in a country
run by chiefs without tribes
no more of all that, only your
brief beauty in many hearts
in a time when fathers bury their sons, and you
surrounded, cut down
in a war you were fated never to see,
blinded by love for all men.

i remember the dusty floorboards of wood in the streetcar
of the minneapolis street railway company
and the varnished yellow banquettes of tight-knit rattan
worn smooth by decades of passengers
the worn gleaming brass grips at the corners of the seats
and the motorman’s little bell
windows trembling in their casings as we crossed the avenue
liberty dimes falling softly into the steel-rimmed hour glass
the gnarled hand of the motorman near.
my grandmother arranged herself against the seat
her back as straight as a soldier’s beside me
her navy hat with velvet band
and net veil down making her head seem distant,
her dreaming smile and the patient roman nose,
a repose so deep; from my place
i watched her when we rode like princes
rattling past traffic stopped on the granite cobbles
riding downtown together, my hands in hers;
all that so much
that i love yet but feel no sadness for, that
time crossed out like the trolley tracks taken up
or entombed under the pliant blacktop of the modernized.

"gulf memo", by stephen sandy [living, death, social commentaries, history & politics, war & conflict]
tell me the way to the wedding
tell me the way to the war,
tell me the needle you’re threading
i won’t raise my voice anymore. and tell me what axe you are grinding
where the boy on the bivouac believes,
what reel you are unwinding
for the girl in her bed who grieves. while behind a derrick’s girder
he watches the sinking sun,
he asks what he’ll do for murder
and what he will do for fun. will you read him the ways of war
his miranda rights in sin,
will you tell him what to ignore
when he studies your discipline? he dozes off—but he shakes
in a dream that he is the one
death finds abed and wakes
just as the night is done. tell me what boats go ashore
riding the oil-dimmed tide,
red streamers and black in store
for the boy with a pain in his side. and tell me where they are heading
tonight; now tell me the score.
tell me the way to their wedding
i won’t raise my own voice anymore.

i passed him by at first. from the photograph
peered sepia eyes, blindered, unappeased
from a lair of brows and beard: one not amazed
at anything, as if to have looked enough
then turned aside worked best for him—as if
night vision was the discipline that eased
the weight of what he saw. a man’s gaze posed
too long in the sun goes blank; comes to grief.
that face could be a focus for this back room,
for pack-rat papers strewn as if in rage,
fond notes unread: each wary eye a phial
unstopped to let huge melville out, to calm
the sea of pages; melville in older age:
the grown man’s sleepy defiance of denial.
<|endoftext|>
﻿<|startoftext|>
after you left me forever,
i was broken into pieces,
and all the pieces flung into the river.
then the legs crawled ashore
and aimlessly wandered the dusty cow-track.
they became, for a while, a simple roadside shrine:
a tiny table set up between the thighs
held a dusty candle, weed-and-fieldflower chains
placed reverently there by children and old women.
my knees were hung with tin triangular medals
to cure all forms of hysterical disease.
after i died forever in the river,
my torso floated, bloated in the stream,
catching on logs or stones among the eddies.
white water foamed around it, then dislodged it;
after a whirlwind trip, it bumped ashore.
a grizzled old man who scavenged along the banks
had already rescued my arms and put them by,
knowing everything has its uses, sooner or later.
when he found my torso, he called it his canoe,
and, using my arms as paddles,
he rowed me up and down the scummy river.
when catfish nibbled my fingers he scooped them up
and blessed his reusable bait.
clumsy but serviceable, that canoe!
the trail of blood that was its wake
attracted the carp and eels, and the river turtle,
easily landed, dazed by my tasty red.
a young lad found my head among the rushes
and placed it on a dry stone.
he carefully combed my hair with a bit of shell
and set small offerings before it
which the birds and rats obligingly stole at night,
so it seemed i ate.
and the breeze wound through my mouth and empty sockets
so my lungs would sigh, and my dead tongue mutter.
attached to my throat like a sacred necklace
was a circlet of small snails.
soon the villagers came to consult my oracular head
with its waterweed crown.
seers found occupation, interpreting sighs,
and their papyrus rolls accumulated.
meanwhile, young boys retrieved my eyes
they used for marbles in a simple game
till somebody’s pretty sister snatched at them
and set them, for luck, in her bridal diadem.
poor girl! when her future groom caught sight of her,
all eyes, he crossed himself in horror,
and stumbled away in haste
through her dowered meadows.
what then of my heart and organs,
my sacred slit
which loved you best of all?
they were caught in a fisherman’s net
and tossed at night into a pen for swine.
but they shone so by moonlight that the sows stampeded,
trampled one another in fear, to get away.
and the fisherman’s wife, who had thirteen living children
and was contemptuous of holy love,
raked the rest of me onto the compost heap.
then in their various places and helpful functions,
the altar, oracle, offal, canoe and oars
learned the wild rumor of your return.
the altar leapt up, and ran to the canoe,
scattering candle grease and wilted grasses.
arms sprang to their sockets, blind hands with nibbled nails
groped their way, aided by loud lamentation,
to the bed of the bride, snatched up those unlucky eyes
from her discarded veil and diadem,
and rammed them home. oh, what a bright day it was!
this empty body danced on the riverbank.
hollow, it called and searched among the fields
for those parts that steamed and simmered in the sun,
and never would have found them.
but then your great voice rang out under the skies
my name!—and all those private names
for the parts and places that had loved you best.
and they stirred in their nest of hay and dung.
the distraught old ladies chasing their lost altar,
and the seers pursuing my skull, their lost employment,
and the tumbling boys, who wanted the magic marbles,
and the runaway groom, and the fisherman’s thirteen children
set up such a clamor, with their cries of “miracle!”
that our two bodies met like a thunderclap
in midday—right at the corner of that wretched field
with its broken fenceposts and startled, skinny cattle.
we fell in a heap on the compost heap
and all our loving parts made love at once,
while the bystanders cheered and prayed and hid their eyes
and then went decently about their business.
and here it is, moonlight again; we’ve bathed in the river
and are sweet and wholesome once more.
we kneel side by side in the sand;
we worship each other in whispers.
but the inner parts remember fermenting hay,
the comfortable odor of dung, the animal incense,
and passion, its bloody labor,
its birth and rebirth and decay.

﻿i’m going to murder you with love;
i’m going to suffocate you with embraces;
i’m going to hug you, bone by bone,
till you’re dead all over.
then i will dine on your delectable marrow.
you will become my personal sahara;
i’ll sun myself in you, then with one swallow
drain your remaining brackish well.
with my female blade i’ll carve my name
in your most aspiring palm
before i chop it down.
then i’ll inhale your last oasis whole.
but in the total desert you become
you’ll see me stretch, horizon to horizon,
opulent mirage!
wisteria balconies dripping cyclamen.
vistas ablaze with crystal, laced in gold.so you will summon each dry grain of sand
and move toward me in undulating dunes
till you arrive at sudden ultramarine:
a mediterranean to stroke your dusty shores;
obstinate verdure, creeping inland, fast renudes
your barrens; succulents spring up everywhere,
surprising life! and i will be that green.
when you are fed and watered, flourishing
with shoots entwining trellis, dome, and spire,
till you are resurrected field in bloom,
i will devour you, my natural food,
my host, my final supper on the earth,
and you’ll begin to die again.﻿

at a party i spy a handsome psychiatrist,
and wish, as we all do, to get her advice for free.
doctor, i’ll say, i’m supposed to be a poet.
all life’s awfulness has been grist to me.
we learn that happiness is a chinese meal,
while sorrow is a nourishment forever.
my new environment is california dreamer.
i’m fearful i’m forgetting how to brood.
and, doctor, another thing has got me worried:
i’m not drinking as much as i should . . .at home, i want to write a happy poem
on love, or a love poem of happiness.
but they won’t do, the tensions of every day,
the rub, the minor abrasions of any two
who share one space. ah, there’s no substitute for tragedy!
but in this chapter, tragedy belongs
to that other life, the old life before us.
here is my aphorism of the day:
happy people are monogamous.
even in california. so how does the poem play without the paraphernalia of betrayal and loss?
i don’t have a jealous eye or fear
and neither do you. in truth, i’m fond
of your ex-mate, whom i name “my wife-in-law.”
my former husband, that old disaster, is now just funny,
so laugh we do, in what cyril connolly
has called the endless, nocturnal conversation
of marriage. which may be the best part.
darling, must i love you in light verse
without the tribute of profoundest art? of course it won’t last. you will break my heart
or i yours, by dying. i could weep over that.
but now it seems forced, here in these heaven hills,
the mourning doves mourning, the squirrels mating,
my old cat warm in my lap, here on our terrace
as from below comes a musical cursing
as you mend my favorite plate. later of course
i could pick a fight; there is always material in that.
but we don’t come from fighting people, those
who scream out red-hot iambs in their hate. no, love, the heavy poem will have to come
from temps perdu, fertile with pain, or perhaps
detonated by terrors far beyond this place
where the world rends itself, and its tainted waters
rise in the east to erode our safety here.
much as i want to gather a lifetime thrift
and craft, my cunning skills tied in a knot for you,
there is only this useless happiness as gift.﻿
<|endoftext|>

tell us how the soul is bound and bent
into these knots, and whether any ever
frees itself from such imprisonment.
—canto xii, inferno 
﻿i say, without a god there is no hell.
there’s only this—. she rustles for her keys.
the apple tree sheds petal after petal.
she says, let’s take you to the hospital.
the petals spin like sparks. i close my eyes
and say, without a god there is no hell,
and there is only this. it’s just as well.
the lawn is red and white. she asks, who says?
how do you know? the wind fells every petal.
she says, let’s take you to the hospital.
i cannot breathe. i cannot tell her, yes—.
because without a god there is no hell,
as she whispers, talk to me, i know i will
clamber—but not toward heaven, toward the sky,
eyes winking behind petal after petal.
the rope-burnt bark will flake away and fall.
knot on my neck, the rest would be so easy:
i’ll pray, without a god there is no hell,
then slip through petals—through petal after petal.

there are some things we just don’t talk about—
not even in the morning, when we’re waking,
when your calloused fingers tentatively walk
the slope of my waist:
how love’s a rust-worn boat,
abandoned at the dock—and who could doubt
waves lick their teeth, eyeing its hull? we’re taking
our wreckage as a promise, so we don’t talk.
we wet the tired oars, tide drawing us out. we understand there’s nothing to be said.
both of us know the dangers of this sea,
warned by the tide-worn driftwood of our pasts—.
but we’ve already strayed from the harbor. we thread
a slow wake though the water—then silently,
we start to row, and will for as long as this lasts.

when he wakes up out of sleep, the brown boy remembers two things: his white man calls and breaks the groans of kevin bacon, naked and writhing in pain on a hard and wet black street. bacon has been beaten with broken bottles and has had his chest smashed in with a large flaming couch section. a mob of whites poured gasoline all over his chiseled stomach and then lit him afire. brad pitt lay next to him, his stomach breathless and glistening in the flame’s light.
the brown boy knows this is somewhere between movie and dream, staring at each stomach; but more importantly, he knows that despite the fire, the bodies did not burn. they did not char or turn black. they simply shined in sweat.
the brown boy will commit to his memory, most, brad pitt’s dying, and how he eventually turned over on his stomach, his penis turned down and scrape fucking the street—brad pitt ejaculating and on fire, the liquid shooting out of him as he looked up, staggered to his feet to let out something between groaning and laughter out to the black sky. though pitt had been beaten with bottles and wood, it was not clear where he was hurt, only that he was a screaming surface, dripping with lit gasoline and semen.
as the brown boy ponders this surface, the white man has chosen to phone his brown boy. their first conversation of the day is bound by this scene—and dutifully, for the white man, he wants to start from the beginning:
brad pitt and kevin bacon are in a boxing ring in the middle of a football field. they are both wearing white boxer shorts, no gloves, and about to perform a dance routine. i am standing next to them, looking at brad pitt’s hair flop down over his face. he smiles at me before the music starts. from everywhere, broken glass bottles hurl at their bodies, and they are splashed with gasoline. we are also in a dark alley lit by fire. the two are still standing, looking over at me, though i can’t tell who is smiling. i only know brad pitt winks at me while kevin bacon is on the street, writhing as a large white flaming couch section is smashed onto his chest. my mother was dead in the dream. i was looking through a dense stash of clothes in a cabinet. all of them were soiled, and none of the clothes were hers. i remember holding a pair of purple and green speedos that were woven to a pair of matching polyester tennis shorts. these shorts were my father’s. i remember my mother making all of his tennis shorts. i also remember pulling out a pair of long sweatpants that were much too large for my mother and holding them up as crumbs fell from the legs. i tried to smell them, wanting to think of her alive.what the brown boy doesn’t say is that he wondered, in the dream, how his father was getting through this—living alone with only her smell left behind. or how he pulled the sweatpants up to his nose and mouth, absorbing the whole of her scent through his body. without revealing his father’s grief or his own, the brown boy breathes in the smell of giorgio mixed with eleven years of shifts at the convalescent home, and gives the white man what he thought he wanted. he quickly shot to the end, where brad pitt grinds his fat cock in the pavement, the curve of it pushing down bent and spewing semen into the street.
kevin bacon stands up and groans, laughing as his bowels leak from his stomach. i was thinking about that before you called. the brown boy knows the white man wants to hear the brown boy rise from sleep, hear the spill from his head in the morning without saying a word. though this morning, to this dream, the white man has two responses: he calls the dream bizarre and says nothing about the brown boy’s mother, only i feel sorry for brad pitt.

when it slides down our houses we say loss is just a condition
we acquire to bury our pity further we say the bleeding hands
on the table filled with red wine
imported products and passports

no groves or shakespeare

growing out of our ribs apologize for the numbers

—one hundred breaths split the air
as i lean
on the only pine tree i find.
it’s early or late, it’s breezy or hot.
the fields are dry. summer is near.
the horses are everywhere,
strangely galloping a dream,
but i can’t remember
how to call them,
so i stand back, watch them pass.—the first time i rode a horse
my body found the music of fire,
crackling the wind. an unbearable pleasure
that also left me with a burn on the side of my leg. a sign, the horsekeeper told me, of longing .a need to return—to belong.
after all, departure is like
pushing the weight of our heart
against the village
whose name has kept us awake.—rafael came from somewhere in eurasia.
i passed my hands through his mane—
saw a history of conquests and battles,
a field of hay, a mount of truth,
heard a silent ring,
his eyes asking me to go with him,
to confess something sacred,
to name something lustful.
nothing of where he came from,
or who i was, disturbed us.—i knew he was different by the way he ran—
without pause,
without grace,
without distraction,
without ease.
he was told how to move in the world
and resented it.
he knew he would never own anything.—he came toward me.
it was a quiet afternoon.
i stood unmoving.
and we listened to the untitled music
circling the earth like an anthem
free of its nation.—he was unfamiliar to me,
approaching as if he possessed the land.
every morning he stopped five feet
from the river.

everything’s happening on the cusp of tragedy, the tip of comedy, the pivot of event.
you want a placid life, find another planet. this one is occupied with the story’s arc:
about to happen, on the verge, horizontal. you want another planet, try the moon.
try any of the eight, try planet x. it’s out there somewhere, black with serenity.
how interesting will our times become? how much more interesting can they become?
a crow with something dangling from its beak flaps onto a telephone pole top, daintily,
and croaks its victory to other crows and tries to keep its morsel to itself.
a limp shape, leggy, stunned, drops from the black beak’s scissors like a rag.
we drive past, commenting, and looking upward. a sunny morning, too cold to be nesting,
unless that is a nest the crow has seized, against the coming spring.
we’ve been at this historical site before, but not in any history we remember.
the present has been cloaked in cloud before, and not on any holy mountaintop.
to know the stars will one day fly apart so far they can’t be seen
is almost a relief. for the future flies in one direction—toward us.
and the only way to sidestep it—the only way—is headed this way, too.so, look. that woman’s got a child by the hand. she’s dragging him across the street.
he’s crying and she’s shouting, but we see only dumbshow. their breath is smoke.
will she give in and comfort him? will he concede at last? we do not know.
their words are smoke. in a minute they’ll be somewhere else entirely.
everyone in a minute will be somewhere else entirely. as the crow flies.

let us think of god as a lover
who never calls,
whose pleasure in us is aroused
in unrepeatable ways,
god as a body we cannot
separate from desire,
saying to us, “your love
is only physical.”
let us think of god as a bronze
with green skin
or a plane that draws the eye close
to the texture of paint.
let us think of god as life,
a bacillus or virus,
as death, an igneous rock
in a quartz garden.
then, let us think of kissing
god with the kisses
of our mouths, of lying with god,
as sea worms lie,
snugly petrifying
in their coral shirts.
let us think of ourselves
as part of god,
neither alive nor dead,
but like alpha, omega,
glyphs and hieroglyphs,
numbers, data.
first forgive the silence
that answers prayer,
then forgive the prayer
that stains the silence.
excuse the absence
that feels like presence,
then excuse the feeling
that insists on presence.
pardon the delay
of revelation,
then ask pardon for revealing
your impatience.
forgive god
for being only a word,
then ask god to forgive
the betrayal of language.
god of the syllable
god of the word
god who speaks to us
god who is dumb
the one god the many
god the unnameable
god of the human face
god of the mask
god of the gene pool
microbe mineral
god of the sparrow’s fall
god of the spark
god of the act of god
blameless jealous
god of surprises
and startling joy
god who is absent
god who is present
god who finds us
in our hiding places
god whom we thank
whom we forget to thank
father god
mother
inhuman infant cosmic chthonic
god of the nucleus
dead god
living god
alpha god
zed god whom we name
god whom we cannot name
when we open our mouths
with the name god
word god.
the new day cancels dread
and dawn forgives all sins,
all the judgments of insomnia,
as if they were only dreams. the ugly confrontation
after midnight, with the mirror,
turns white around the edges
and burns away like frost. daylight undoes gravity
and lightness responds to the light.
the new day lifts all weight,
like stepping off into space. where is that room you woke to,
by clock-light, at 3 a.m.?
nightmare’s many mansions,
falling, have taken it with them.
the new day, the day’s newness,
and the wretchedness that, you thought,
would never, never depart,
meet—and there is goodbye. a bad night lies ahead
and a new day beyond that—
a simple sequence, but hard
to remember in the right order.
lord of dimensions and the dimensionless,
wave and particle, all and none, who lets us measure the wounded atom,
who lets us doubt all measurement, when in this world we betray you
let us be faithful in another.

i think continually of those who were truly great.
who, from the womb, remembered the soul’s history
through corridors of light, where the hours are suns,
endless and singing. whose lovely ambition
was that their lips, still touched with fire,
should tell of the spirit, clothed from head to foot in song.
and who hoarded from the spring branches
the desires falling across their bodies like blossoms. what is precious, is never to forget
the essential delight of the blood drawn from ageless springs
breaking through rocks in worlds before our earth.
never to deny its pleasure in the morning simple light
nor its grave evening demand for love.
never to allow gradually the traffic to smother
with noise and fog, the flowering of the spirit. near the snow, near the sun, in the highest fields,
see how these names are fêted by the waving grass
and by the streamers of white cloud
and whispers of wind in the listening sky.
the names of those who in their lives fought for life,
who wore at their hearts the fire’s centre.
born of the sun, they travelled a short while toward the sun
and left the vivid air signed with their honour.

someone spoke to me last night,
told me the truth. just a few words,
but i recognized it.
i knew i should make myself get up,
write it down, but it was late,
and i was exhausted from working
all day in the garden, moving rocks.
now, i remember only the flavor —
not like food, sweet or sharp.
more like a fine powder, like dust.
and i wasn’﻿t elated or frightened,
but simply rapt, aware.
that’﻿s how it is sometimes —
god comes to your window,
all bright light and black wings,
and you’﻿re just too tired to open it.

i am saying the ocean shimmered like corrugated steel in the

the context of my story changes when you enter. then i am dung
on the wall of the nomad’﻿s field. then the everyday waking person.
i am nodding in your direction like fissures between dandelion fur.
seeing in your manner.
i am speaking your pace. slippage of silk slippers.
i say you are losing sight. i say your breasts are dry shells.
i am afraid of what i am capable of doing.
this is all a manner of stating how i prepare myself to be loved.﻿

her voice is a roundness. on full moon days, she talks about
renouncing meat but the butcher has his routine. and blood.
m’﻿s wisdom. still reliable.
there are sounds we cannot hear but understand in motion.
slicing of air with hips. crushing grass, saying these are my feet.
i want my feet in my shadow. suffice to meet desires halfway.
quiet. we say her chakras are in place.
when the thermos shatters, she knows the direction of its spill.
she knows how to lead and follow. know her from this.
sounds we cannot hear. the wind blows and we say it is cool.
night slips under the door. we are tucked into bed and kissed
a fleeting one. through the curtains, her voice loosens like thread
from an old blanket, row upon row. we watch her teeth in the
dark and read her words. she speaks in perfect order, facing where
the breeze can tug it towards canals stretching for sound.
her faith abides by the cycle of the moon. see how perfect she is.

late for the feast. let me guess, she said, everything worked
against you.
some pulverize experiences at the pool. when the air slaps, they
flip into the water and speak of the excitations of distress. the
stratagems of delivering an annulled emotion. and how is one to
read a nod? is a nod an exclamation?
does one kiss after a nod?
a woman mutters something about the tea being too weak.
the walls threaten to expose us, shadows pinch as we mutter
jouissance, jouissance, while the university teacher said the use of
the word was a considerable error. a most lamentable error, given
half of us are illiterate and unattached. think of words in their

a hundred and one butter lamps are offered to my uncle who
is no more.
distraction proves fatal in death. a curtain of butter imprints
in air.
after the burning of bones, ashes are sent on pilgrimage. you are
dead, go into life, we pray. my uncle was a man given to giggles
in solemn moments.
memory springs like crocuses in bloom. self conscious and
precise.
without blurring the cornea, details are resuscitated. dried yak
meat between teeth. semblance of what is.
do not be distracted, uncle who is no more.
he does not see his reflection in the river. the arching of speech
over “s” as he is becoming.
curvature of spine as it cracked on a misty morning. a shadow
evades the wall.
you are no more, uncle who is no more.
every seven days he must relive his moment of expiration.
the living pray frequently amid burning juniper.
communication efforts require the right initiative.
somewhere along the line matters of motion and rest are resolved.
crows pick the last offerings. you are someone else, uncle no
more.

although what glitters
on the trees,
row after perfect row,
is merely
the injustice
of the world,
the chips on the bark of each
beech tree
catching the light, the sum
of these delays
is the beautiful, the human
beautiful,
body of flaws.
the dead
would give anything
i’﻿m sure,
to step again onto
the leafrot,
into the avenue of mottled shadows,
the speckled
broken skins. the dead
in their sheer
open parenthesis, what they
wouldn’﻿t give
for something to lean on
that won’﻿t
give way. i think i
would weep
for the moral nature
of this world,
for right and wrong like pools
of shadow
and light you can step in
and out of
crossing this yellow beech forest,
this buchen-wald,
one autumn afternoon, late
in the twentieth
century, in hollow light,
in gaseous light. . . .
to receive the light
and return it
and stand in rows, anonymous,
is a sweet secret
even the air wishes
it could unlock.
see how it pokes at them
in little hooks,
the blue air, the yellow trees.
why be afraid?
they say when klimt
died suddenly
a painting, still
incomplete,
was found in his studio,
a woman’﻿s body
open at its point of
entry,
rendered in graphic,
pornographic,
detail—something like
a scream
between her legs. slowly,
feathery,
he had begun to paint
a delicate
garment (his trademark)
over this mouth
of her body. the mouth
of her face
is genteel, bored, feigning a need
for sleep. the fabric
defines the surface,
the story,
so we are drawn to it,
its blues
and yellows glittering
like a stand
of beech trees late
one afternoon
in germany, in fall.
it is called
buchenwald, it is
1890. in
the finished painting
the argument
has something to do
with pleasure.

july 20, 1969 that afternoon in mid-july,
two pilgrims watched from distant space
the moon ballooning in the sky.
they rose to meet it face-to-face.
their spidery spaceship, eagle, dropped
down gently on the lunar sand.
and when the module's engines stopped,
rapt silence fell across the land.
the first man down the ladder, neil,
spoke words that we remember now—
“one small step...” it made us feel
as if we were there too, somehow.
when neil planted the flag and buzz
collected lunar rocks and dust,
they hopped like kangaroos because
of gravity. or wanderlust?
a quarter million miles away,
one small blue planet watched in awe.
and no one who was there that day
will soon forget the sight they saw.

looking over a mud puddle
'cause i didn't have a paddle

so i saddled up a leaf.
i set sail on the puddle,

and i solved the mighty riddle
of the whole caboodle puddle

we dreamed of glowing children, their throats alive and cancerous, their eyes like lightning in the dark. we were uneasy in our skins, sixth grade, a year for blowing up, for learning that nothing contains that heat which comes from growing, the way our parents seemed at once both tall as cooling towers and crushed beneath the pressure of small things— family dinners, the evening news, the dead voice of the dial tone. even the ground was ticking. the parts that grew grew poison. whatever we ate became a stone. whatever we said was love became plutonium, became a spark of panic in the buried world.﻿

alone in the library room, even when others
are there in the room, alone, except for themselves:
there is the illusion of peace; the air in the room
is stilled; there are reading lights on the tables,
looking as if they're reading, looking as if
they're studying the text, and understanding,
shedding light on what the words are saying;
but under their steady imbecile gaze the page
is blank, patiently waiting not to be blank.
the page is blank until the mind that reads
crosses the black river, seeking the queen
of the underworld, persephone, where she sits
by the side of the one who brought her there from enna,
hades the mute, the deaf, king of the dead letter;
she is clothed in the beautiful garment of our thousand
misunderstandings of the sacred text.

how do you know if it’s love? she asks, and i think if you have to ask, it’s not, but i know this won’t help. i want to say you’re too young to worry about it, as if she has questions about medicare or social security, but this won’t help either. “you’ll just know” is a lie, and one truth, “when you still want to be with them the next morning,” would involve too many follow-up questions. the difficulty with love, i want to say, is sometimes you only know afterwards that it’s arrived or left. love is the elephant and we are the blind mice unable to understand the whole. i want to say love is this desire to help even when i know i can’t, just as i couldn’t explain electricity, stars, the color of the sky, baldness, tornadoes, fingernails, coconuts, or the other things she has asked about over the years, all those phenomena whose daily existence seems miraculous. instead i shake my head. i don’t even know how to match my socks. go ask your mother. she laughs and says, i did. mom told me to come and ask you.

eastham, massachusettsone of the spectators is disappointed
there isn’t a guide to explain
the beaching, the scientists busy
cutting into ninety-four pilot whales
stranded on the salt grass.
no one knows why and, try as the rescue team
might, not one whale will go back to water.
so they’re injected to speed up the dying, lined up like lumber and sawed into,
except when the black skin splits
we can’t stop staring, their meat is so red.
i don’t want to know why this happens—
what parasite or geomagnetic anomaly
finished their love of motion. why should
anything have to leave this world
when water can cycle from atmosphere
down to land, the ocean and back
to forgiving sky. i’m on my way to connecticut
where my father has a little vegetation
on his heart valve—that’s how the intern
describes it, trying to minimize
the danger of him slipping
into a haze so cold, some nights,
bone-cold, his hand can’t get from
his plate to his mouth. rain slicks the highway
slowing me down. the same water
fattened into snow in the woods
of my childhood, the whiteness
unbroken except where my father
cut trails and taught me to ski,
laying down the herringbone behind him
as he broke up hills that left me
with legs made of slush. he wanted me strong,
no patience for pain. no choice
but to find the muscle to follow. even now
when he boasts how i zigzagged
the breakneck hills in an icestorm,
there’s no hint of my knee-chattering fear,
slats skittering out of control,
each run a victory of luck more than will,
each ride up the lift a prayer for my bones.
i wonder how it is for him now
there in the ward where whiteness can’t hide
the cold blank that’s ahead. when the whales
beached, spectators came like pilgrims,
each new arrival scanning the faces
of those heading back to their cars
to see how it changed them
to survey so much death. nothing showed.
their eyes followed the asphalt,
heads bent in private devotion. there in a room
where others have died, my father
keeps a record of each test and drug.
he watches medicine drip into his arm
and circle in the dark of his blood.
i believe it will heal him, as i believe
in the strength of my blood
to protect me from failures of will. once
when my grandmother at ninety-six
lay delirious with pneumonia,
pitching on her high horsehair bed,
she saw three crows perched on the dresser. they smell so awful, she said. please, open the window. let them out.
it was my father who did what she asked.
and the crows flew out, carrying her fever
over the treeline, dissolving into sky,
and she lived. whatever she saw,
by love, luck or dumb yankee will,
it was true. that’s what i mean by medicine.

he’ll have been the last of his kind here then.
the flagstones, dry-stone walls, the slumping thatch,
out-offices and cow cabins, the patch
of haggard he sowed spuds and onions in—
all of it a century out of fashion—
all giving way to the quiet rising damp
of hush and vacancy once he is gone.
those long contemplations at the fire, cats
curling at the door, the dog’s lame waltzing,
the kettle, the candle and the lamp—
all still, all quenched, all darkened—
the votives and rosaries and novenas,
the pope and kennedy and sacred heart,
the bucket, the basket, the latch and lock,
the tractor that took him into town and back
for the pension cheque and messages and pub,
the chair, the bedstead and the chamber pot,
everything will amount to nothing much.
everything will slowly disappear.
and some grandniece, a sister’s daughter’s daughter,
one blue august in ten or fifteen years
will marry well and will inherit it:
the cottage ruins, the brown abandoned land.
they’ll come to see it in a hired car.
the kindly liverpudlian she’s wed,
in concert with a local auctioneer,
will post a sign to offer site for sale.
the acres that he labored in will merge
with a neighbor’s growing pasturage
and all the decades of him will begin to blur,
easing, as the far fields of his holding did,
up the hill, over the cliff, into the sea.

we were dancing—it must have
been a foxtrot or a waltz,
something romantic but
requiring restraint,
rise and fall, precise
execution as we moved
into the next song without
stopping, two chests heaving
above a seven-league
stride—such perfect agony,
one learns to smile through,
ecstatic mimicry
being the sine qua non
of american smooth.
and because i was distracted
by the effort of
keeping my frame
(the leftward lean, head turned
just enough to gaze out
past your ear and always
smiling, smiling),
i didn’t notice
how still you’d become until
we had done it

four?)—achieved flight,
that swift and serene
magnificence,
before the earth
remembered who we were
and brought us down. ﻿

flash vanishes into stillness,
hawk addled by the sudden loss of sight: honor the chemistries, platelets, hemoglobin kinetics,
the light-sensitive iris, the enzymic intricacies
of control, the gastric transformations, seed
dissolved to acrid liquors, synthesized into
chirp, vitreous humor, knowledge, blood compulsion, instinct: honor the
unique genes,
molecules that reproduce themselves, divide into sets, the nucleic grain transmitted
in slow change through ages of rising and falling form,
some cells set aside for the special work, mind or perception rising into orders of courtship,
territorial rights, mind rising
from the physical chemistries to guarantee that genes will be exchanged, male
and female met, the satisfactions cloaking a deeper
racial satisfaction: heat kept by a feathered skin:
the living alembic, body heat maintained (bunsen
burner under the flask)so the chemistries can proceed, reaction rates
interdependent, self-adjusting, with optimum
efficiency—the vessel firm, the flame staying: isolated, contained reactions! the precise and
necessary worked out of random, reproducible,
the handiwork redeemed from chance, while the goldfinch, unconscious of the billion operations
that stay its form, flashes, chirping (not a
great songster) in the bay cherry bushes wild of leaf.

in the heavy fashion magazines strewn here and there around the house the photos of objects and people mouth the word “money,” but you, assuming no one wants you anymore, mishear the message as “meaning.” arousal follows. the lives of the rich are so fabulous! the destruction of the poetical lies heavily on their hands, as on their swollen notion that we are always watching. there is nothing behind the mask. nothing suffocating under its pressure, no human essence trying to get out.
awareness, always awareness. don’t you see how these elaborate masks are turning you into a zombie? the private life is not for the eye but for the endless interior. it is trying to push all this crap aside and find the missing line. nobody, least of all the future, cares about the outcome of this quest.
it is easy to lose, through meddling or neglect, an entire aspect of existence. and sometimes, to cultivate a single new thought, you need not only silence but an entirely new life.

wiretaps and tapes, concealed
bugs and mikes,
intercepted letters
full of passionate declarations, contradictory
intelligence—
how attached he’d grown
to the subject’s documents, revising and rearranging
the influx of intelligence
with a sentiment, he acknowledged, almost
like love: he felt
the cool gray eyes of his superiors
trained on him, rebuking him
for swerving, for letting
himself go—such tender obsession
occasioned by the file!
not quite the professional style
he or the agency expected…but such official loyalties
seemed mere protocol to this!—
what was wrong with him,
he wondered, that he construed
the documents to make the subject
seem a hero,
a bastard whose sole patrimony
was a pair of shoes and a rusted sword
left by an unknown father beneath a stone?
and yet his exploits in the tabloids,
the headlines screaming, scourge of monsters strikes again!
hero founds republic were these heroic
different in kind from the rumors,
unverified,
of a rape, a murder?—but to have met undisguised the devouring monster!
to have escaped the twisting tunnels of the maze…on balance, for such a life,
the hero’s reputation wasn’t bad:
think of the opportunities for evil
a man of such qualities must have had!
how well he knew him—an essential innocence
that followed impulse, blind
to protocol, not noticeably more kind
than he was cruel.
but to stamp case closed and cease
gathering intelligence,
to give the hero up, almost, he admitted,
like a lover…:
such limits the hero
unknowingly transgressed!
and the agency, cold-blooded where
limits were concerned (“mere protocol”?—
more like a second backbone!), committed
to keeping order, could not afford
such sentiments—the chief of security
felt an awful pang: that the work of intelligence
should lead to this…he leaned back in his chair and sighed:
a forged genealogy certifying
that the hero’s father was a king; a mutual
assistance pact
to aid in taking back the usurped crown:
he could see them now, the wind
blowing lightly, the two of them sweating
as they climbed the cliff, discussing
the terms, exchanging information,
intelligence—
how would his own face look
staring down across the sea
as he gestured earnestly toward
some island, saying,
“according to our sources,
the tax revenues…”
and then, edging
the hero closer to the cliff, pointing

when i woke the darkness was so thick,
so palpable and black that my eyes
seemed blind as stone staring into stone. the blade that i had dreamed, efficient and quick
as it cut into my thigh, cleaning a gangrened
wound infected to the bone, seemed poised above my throat: close-grained, impenetrable,
the blackness rose before me like a wall.
and then off in the next room, nervous, light, a soft padding as of an animal
raced like my heartbeat in my temples
round and round, trapped, stealthily desperate as if hunting its own track, terrified
and captivated by its own odor.
skin cool in the night air, eyes drilling through the dark, who i was before i
slept had burned off like a vapor
so that amnesiac and pure, witnessing my terror that i no longer recognized
as my own, my mind floated beyond me
to confront that frantic, closing footfall as jacob dreaming met his dark angel—
though in my wrestling nothing blessed me
or promised any blessing; but was a mask whose eyeswere all black pupil, blind as molten tar.
i strained to see what paced there, my eyes burning
through the dark until a pair of eyes blazed back across the blackness, an insistent, glazed
staring that shimmered and disappeared.
the shining blade plunged at my throat, my mind stretched and twisted, its wires tightening
and turning as the creature lunged back and forth
and with a deep-throated yowling, thrashing and thrashing to fight clear of its own circling,
cleanly leapt away. i reached for the knife
but gripped only air, my eyes pressing deeper and deeper into the night’s black stone,
cutting the way the knife had cut into my wound,
probing for the white shining of the bone: what had i become? what darkness had my dream
led me down into? too frightened even
to move, i lay bound and sweating in the sheets, the moon a warning-bell beating
on the glass, its light carving out the curtains
like the shadow of a wing across the windowpane.

it is very hot—92 today—to be wearing a stocking cap, but the adolescent swaggering through the grocery store automatic door doesn’t seem to mind; does not even appear to be perspiring. the tugged-down hat is part of his carefully orchestrated outfit: bagging pants, screaming t-shirt, high-topped shoes. the young woman who yells to her friends from an open pickup window is attired for summer season in strapless stretch tube top, slipping down toward bountiful cleavage valley. she tugs it up in front as she races toward the two who have just passed a cigarette between them like a baton on a relay team. her white chest gleams like burnished treasure as they giggle loudly there in the corner and i glance down to see what costume i have selected to present myself to the world today. i smile; it’s my sky blue shirt with large deliberately faded peace sign, smack dab in the middle, plus grey suede birkenstocks—a message that “i lived through the sixties and am so proud.” none of the young look my way. i round the corner and walk into evening descending.﻿

love song for the newly divorce done day, you will awake from your covering and that heart of yours will be totally mended, and there will be no more burning within. the owl, calling in the setting of the sun and the deer path, all erased. and there will be no more need for love or lovers or fears of losing lovers and there will be no more burning timbers with which to light a new fire, and there will be no more husbands or people related to husbands, and there will be no more tears or reason to shed your tears. you will be as mended as the bridge the working crew has just reopened. the thick air will be vanquished with the tide and the river that was corrupted by lies will be cleansed and totally free. and the rooster will call in the setting sun and the sun will beckon homeward, hiding behind your one tree that was not felled.

and with great fear i inhabit the middle of the night
what wrecks of the mind await me, what drugs
to dull the senses, what little i have left,
what more can be taken away?
the fear of travelling, of the future without hope
or buoy. i must get away from this place and see
that there is no fear without me: that it is within
unless it be some sudden act or calamity
to land me in the hospital, a total wreck, without
memory again; or worse still, behind bars. if
i could just get out of the country. some place
where one can eat the lotus in peace.
for in this country it is terror, poverty awaits; or
am i a marked man, my life to be a lesson
or experience to those young who would trod
the same path, without god
unless he be one of justice, to wreak vengeance
on the acts committed while young under un-
due influence or circumstance. oh i have
always seen my life as drama, patterned
after those who met with disaster or doom.
is my mind being taken away me.
i have been over the abyss before. what
is that ringing in my ears that tells me
all is nigh, is naught but the roaring of the winter wind.
woe to those homeless who are out on this night.
woe to those crimes committed from which we
can walk away unharmed.
so i turn on the light
and smoke rings rise in the air.
do not think of the future; there is none.
but the formula all great art is made of.
pain and suffering. give me the strength
to bear it, to enter those places where the
great animals are caged. and we can live
at peace by their side. a bride to the burden
that no god imposes but knows we have the means
to sustain its force unto the end of our days.
for that is what we are made for; for that
we are created. until the dark hours are done.
and we rise again in the dawn.
infinite particles of the divine sun, now
worshipped in the pitches of the night.

the burnt church up the street yawns to the sky, its empty windows edged in soot, its portals boarded up and slathered with graffiti, oily layers, urgent but illegible. all that can be plundered has been, all but the carapace—the hollow bell tower, the fieldstone box that once served as a nave. the tidy row of homes that line this block have tended lawns and scalloped bathtub shrines. each front porch holds a chair where no one sits. those who live here triple lock their doors day and night. some mornings they step out to find a smoking car stripped to its skeleton abandoned at the curb. most afternoons the street is still but for a mourning dove and gangs of pigeons picking through the grass. our lady of perpetual help is gray, a dead incisor in a wary smile. a crevice in her wall allows a glimpse into the chancel, where a sodden mattress and dirty blanket indicate that someone finds this place a sanctuary still, takes his rest here, held and held apart from passers by, their cruelties and their kindnesses, watched over by the night’s blind congregation, by the blank eyes of a concrete saint.﻿

when it is cold it stinks, and not till then.
the seasonable or more rabid heats of love and summer in some other cities unseal the all too human: not in his. when it is cold it stinks, but not before;
smells to high heaven then most creaturely when it is cold. it stinks, but not before his freezing eye has done its best to maim, to amputate limbs, livelihood and name, abstracting life beyond all likelihood.
when it is cold it stinks, and not till then can it be fragrant. on canal and street, colder and colder, murphy to molloy, the weather hardens round the idiot boy, the gleeful hero of the long retreat.
when he is cold he stinks, but not before, this living corpse. the existential weather smells out in these abortive minims, men who barely living therefore altogether live till they die; and sweetly smell till then.

x, whom society’s most mild command,
for instance evening dress, infuriates, in art is seen confusingly to stand for disciplined conformity, with yeats.
taxed to explain what this resentment is he feels for small proprieties, it comes, he likes to think, from old enormities and keeps the faith with famous martyrdoms.
yet it is likely, if indeed the crimes his fathers suffered rankle in his blood, that he find least excusable the times when they acceded, not when they withstood.
how else explain this bloody-minded bent to kick against the prickings of the norm; when to conform is easy, to dissent; and when it is most difficult, conform?

yet the after is still a storm
as witness bent shadbush and cord grass in stillness
sand littered with the smallest of fragments whether shell or bone that city we are far from

while the ash settles, so fine that planes keep falling from the sky and the name once again to be the old one
saint something, saint gesture, saint entirely the same as if nothing or no one had been nameless in the interim or as if still could be placed beside storm

the bend in the river followed us for days
and above us the sun doubled and redoubled its claims
now we are in a house with forty-four walls and nothing but doors

or so someone claims, the ice man perhaps, all enclosed in ice though the light has been shortening our days
and coloring nights the yellow of hay, scarlet of trillium, blue of block ice words appear, the texture of ice,
with messages etched on their shells: minna 1892, big max and little sarah, this hour ago
everyone watched as the statues fell enough of such phrases and we’ll have a book enough of such books
and we’ll have mountains of ice enough to balance our days with nights enough at last to close our eyes

yes, i was born on the street known as glass—as paper, scissors or rock.
several of my ancestors had no hands.
several of my ancestors used their pens
in odd ways.
a child of seven i prayed for breath.
each day i passed through the mirrored xinto droplets of rain congealed around dust.
i never regretted this situation.
though patient as an alchemist i failed to learn english.
twenty years later i burned all my furniture.
likewise the beams of my house
to fuel the furnace. once i bought an old boat.
i abandoned the tyrannical book of my dreams
and wrote about dresses, jewels, furniture and menus
eight or ten times in a book of dreams.
it sets me to dreaming when i dust it off.
our time is a between time; best to stay out of it. send an occasional visiting card to eternity or a few stanzas to the living
so they won’t suspect we know they don’t exist.
sign them sincerely yours, warmest regards, thinking of you or deepest regrets.
brown river outside my window, an old boat riding the current.
what i like most is to stay in my apartment.
so that is my life, pared of anecdotes. i go out occasionally to look at a dance.
otherwise the usual joys, worries and inner mourning.
occasionally in an old boat i navigate the river
when i find the time.
water swallows the days.
i think maybe that’s all i have to say
except that an irregular heart sometimes speaks to me.
it says, a candle is consuming a children’s alphabet.
it says, attend to each detail of the future-past.
last night the moon was divided precisely in half.

i look in the turned sod for an iron bolt that fell from the plow frame and find instead an arrowhead with delicate, chipped edges, still sharp, not much larger than a woman’s long fingernail. pleased, i put the arrowhead into my overalls pocket, knowing that the man who shot the arrow and lost his work must have looked for it much longer than i will look for that bolt.

 i drove to oak park, took two tours,
and looked at some of the houses.
i took the long way back along the lake.
the place that i came home to—a cavernous
apartment on the east side of milwaukee—
seems basically a part of that tradition,
with the same admixture of expansion and restraint:
the space takes off, yet leaves behind a nagging
feeling of confinement, with the disconcerting sense
that while the superficial conflicts got resolved,
the underlying tensions brought to equilibrium,
it isn’t yet a place in which i feel that i can live.
imagine someone reading. contemplate a man
oblivious to his settings, and then a distant person
standing in an ordinary room, hemmed in by limitations,
yet possessed by the illusion of an individual life
that blooms within its own mysterious enclosure,
in a solitary space in which the soul can breathe
and where the heart can stay—not by discovering it,
but by creating it, by giving it a self-sustaining
atmosphere of depth, both in the architecture,
and in the unconstructed life that it contains.
in a late and very brief remark, freud speculates
that space is the projection of a “psychic apparatus”
which remains almost entirely oblivious to itself;
and wright extols “that primitive sense of shelter”
which can turn a house into a refuge from despair.
i wish that time could bring the future back again
and let me see things as they used to seem to me
before i found myself alone, in an emancipated state—
alone and free and filled with cares about tomorrow.
there used to be a logic in the way time passed
that made it flow directly towards an underlying space
where all the minor, individual lives converged.
the moments borrowed their perceptions from the past
and bathed the future in a soft, familiar light
i remembered from home, and which has faded.
and the voices get supplanted by the rain,
the nights seem colder, and the angel in the mind
that used to sing to me beneath the wide suburban sky
turns into dreamwork and dissolves into the air,
while in its place a kind of monument appears,
magnificent in isolation, compromised by proximity
and standing in a small and singular expanse—
as though the years had been a pretext for reflection,
and my life had been a phase of disenchantment—
as the faces that i cherished gradually withdraw,
the reassuring settings slowly melt away,
and what remains is just a sense of getting older.
in a variation of the parable, the pure of heart
descend into a kingdom that they never wanted
and refused to see. the homely notions of the good,
the quaint ideas of perfection swept away like
adolescent fictions as the real forms of life
deteriorate with manically increasing speed,
the kind man wakes into a quiet dream of shelter,
and the serenity it brings—not in reflection,
but in the paralyzing fear of being mistaken,
of losing everything, of acquiescing in the
obvious approach (the house shaped like a box;
the life that can’t accommodate another’s)—
as the heart shrinks down to tiny, local things. why can’t the more expansive ecstasies come true?
i met you more than thirty years ago, in 1958,
in mrs. wolford’s eighth grade history class.
all moments weigh the same, and matter equally;
yet those that time brings back create the fables
of a happy or unsatisfying life, of minutes
passing on the way to either peace or disappointment—
like a paper calendar on which it’s always autumn
and we’re back in school again; or a hazy afternoon
near the beginning of october, with the world series
playing quietly on the radio, and the windows open,
and the california sunlight filling up the room.
when i survey the mural stretched across the years
—across my heart—i notice mostly small, neglected
parts of no importance to the whole design, but which,
in their obscurity, seem more permanent and real.
i see the desks and auditorium, suffused with
yellow light connoting earnestness and hope that
still remains there, in a space pervaded by a
soft and supple ache too deep to contemplate—
as though the future weren’t real, and the present
were amorphous, with nothing to hold on to,
and the past were there forever. and the art
that time inflicts upon its subjects can’t
eradicate the lines sketched out in childhood,
which harden into shapes as it recedes.
i wish i knew a way of looking at the world
that didn’t find it wanting, or of looking at my
life that didn’t always see a half-completed
structure made of years and filled with images
and gestures emblematic of the past, like gatsby’s
light, or proust’s imbalance on the stones.
i wish there were a place where i could stay
and leave the world alone—an enormous stadium
where i could wander back and forth across a field
replete with all the incidents and small details
that gave the days their textures, that bound the
minutes into something solid, and that linked them
all together in a way that used to seem eternal.
we used to go to dances in my family’s ancient
cadillac, which blew up late one summer evening
climbing up the hill outside del mar. and later
i can see us steaming off the cover of the beatles’
baby-butcher album at your house in mission bay;
and three years later listening to the velvet
underground performing in a roller skating rink.
years aren’t texts, or anything like texts;
and yet i often think of 1968 that way, as though
that single year contained the rhythms of the rest,
as what began in hope and eagerness concluded in
intractable confusion, as the wedding turned into a
puzzling fiasco over poor john godfrey’s hair.
the parts were real, and yet the dense and living
whole they once composed seems broken now, its
voice reduced to disembodied terms that speak to me
more distantly each day, until the tangled years
are finally drained of feeling, and collapse into a
sequence of the places where we lived: your parents’
house in kensington, and mine above the canyon:
then the flat by sears in cambridge, where we
moved when we got married, and the third floor
of the house on francis avenue, near harvard square;
the big apartment in milwaukee where we lived the
year that john was born, and last of all the
house in whitefish bay, where you live now
and all those years came inexplicably undone
in mid-july. the sequence ended late last year.
suppose we use a lifetime as a measure of the world
as it exists for one. then half of mine has ended,
while the fragment which has recently come to be
contains no vantage point from which to see it whole.
i think that people are the sum of their illusions,
that the cares that make them difficult to see
are eased by distance, with their errors blending
in an intricate harmony, their truths abiding
in a subtle “spark” or psyche (each incomparable,
yet each the same as all the others) and their
disparate careers all joined together in a tangled
moral vision whose intense, meandering design
seems lightened by a pure simplicity of feeling,
as in grief, or in the pathos of a life
cut off by loneliness, indifference or hate,
because the most important thing is human happiness—
not in the sense of private satisfactions, but of
lives that realize themselves in ordinary terms
and with the quiet inconsistencies that make them real.
the whole transcends its tensions, like the intimate
reflections on the day that came at evening, whose
significance was usually overlooked, or misunderstood,
because the facts were almost always unexceptional.
two years ago we took our son to paris. last night
i picked him up and took him to a lou reed show,
and then took him home. i look at all the houses as i
walk down hackett avenue to work. i teach my classes,
visit friends, cook introspective meals for myself,
yet in the end the minutes don’t add up. what’s lost
is the perception of the world as something good
and held in common; as a place to be perfected
in the kinds of everyday divisions and encounters
that endowed it with integrity and structure,
and that merged its private moments with the past.
what broke it into pieces? what transformed the
flaws that gave it feeling into objects of a deep and
smoldering resentment—like coming home too early,
or walking too far ahead of you on the rue jacob?
i wish that life could be a window on the sun,
instead of just this porch where i can stand and
contemplate the wires that lace the parking lot
and feel it moving towards some unknown resolution.
the guggenheim museum just reopened. tonight i
watched a segment of the news on pbs—narrated by a
woman we met years ago at bob’s—that showed how
most of wright’s interior had been restored,
and how the ramp ascends in spirals towards the sky.
i like the houses better—they flow in all directions,
merging with the scenery and embodying a milder,
more domestic notion of perfection, on a human scale
that doesn’t overwhelm the life that it encloses.
isn’t there a way to feel at home within the
confines of this bland, accommodating structure
made of souvenirs and emblems, like the hammock
hanging in the backyard of an undistinguished
prairie school house in whitefish bay—the lineal,
reduced descendant of the “flameproof” wright house
just a block or two away from where i live now?
i usually walk along the street on sunday,
musing on how beautiful it seems, how aspects of it
recapitulate the oak park house and studio, with
open spaces buried in a labyrinthine interior,
and with the entrance half-concealed on the side—
a characteristic feature of his plans that made it
difficult to find, although the hope was that in
trying to get inside, the visitor’s eye would come to
linger over subtleties he might have failed to see—
in much the way that in the course of getting older,
and trying to reconstruct the paths that led me here,
i found myself pulled backwards through these old,
uncertain passages, distracted by the details,
and meeting only barriers to understanding why the
years unfolded as they did, and why my life
turned out the way it has—like his signature
“pathway of discovery,” with each diversion
adding to the integrity of the whole.
there is this sweep life has that makes the
accidents of time and place seem small.
everything alters, and the personal concerns
that love could hold together for a little while
decay, and then the world seems strange again,
and meaningless and free. i miss the primitive
confusions, and the secret way things came to me
each evening, and the pain. i still wonder
where the tears went, standing in my room each day
and quietly inhabiting a calm, suspended state
enveloped by the emptiness that scares and thrills me,
with the background noise cascading out of nothing
like a song that makes the days go by, a song
incorporating everything—not into what it says,
but simply in the way it touches me, a single
image of dispersal, the inexhaustible perception
of contingency and transience and isolation.
it brings them back to me. i have the inwardness
i think i must have wanted, and the quietude,
the solitary temper, and this space where i can
linger with the silence curling all around me
like the sound of pure passage, waiting here
surrounded by the furniture, the books and lists
and all these other emblems of the floating world,
the prints of raindrops that begin as mist, that fall
discreetly through the atmosphere, and disappear.
and then i feel them in the air, in a reserved,
more earthly music filled with voices reassembling
in a wellspring of remembrance, talking to me again,
and finding shelter in the same evasive movements
i can feel in my own life, cloaked in a quiet
dignity that keeps away the dread of getting old,
and fading out of other people’s consciousness,
and dying –with its deepest insecurities and fears
concealed by their own protective colorations,
as the mind secretes its shell and calls it home.
it has the texture of an uncreated substance,
hovering between the settings it had come to love
and some unformulated state i can’t imagine—
waiting for the telephone to ring, obsessed with
ways to occupy these wide, unstructured hours,
and playing records by myself, and waking up alone.
all things are disparate, yet subject to the same
intense, eradicating wills of time and personality,
like waves demolishing the walls love seemed to build
between our lives and emptiness, the certainty they
seemed to have just two or three short years ago,
before the anger spread its poison over everything.
i think about the way our visions locked together
in a nightmare play of nervousness and language,
living day to day inside the concentrated
force of that relentless argument, whose words
swept over us in formless torrents of anxiety, two
people clinging to their versions of their lives
almost like children—living out each other’s
intermittent fantasies, that fed upon themselves
as though infected by some vile, concentrated hatred;
who then woke up and planned that evening’s dinner.
it’s all memories now, and distance. miles away
the cat is sleeping on the driveway, john’s in school,
and sunlight filters through a curtain in the kitchen.
nothing really changes—the external world intrudes
and then withdraws, and then becomes continuous again.
i went downtown today and got a lamp with pendant
lanterns made of opalescent art glass—part, i guess,
of what this morning’s paper called the “wright craze.”
i like the easy way the days go by, the parts of aging
that have come to seem familiar, and the uneventful
calm that seems to settle on the house at night.
each morning brings the mirror’s reassuring face,
as though the years had left the same enduring person
simplified and changed—no longer vaguely desperate,
no longer torn, yet still impatient with himself
and still restless; but drained of intricacy and rage,
like a mild paradox—uninteresting in its own right,
yet existing for the sake of something stranger.
now and then our life comes over me, in brief,
involuntary glimpses of that world that blossom
unexpectedly, in fleeting moments of regret
that come before the ache, the pang that gathers
sharply, like an indrawn breath—a strange and
thoughtful kind of pain, as though a steel
band had somehow snapped inside my heart.
i don’t know. but what i do know is that
none of it is ever going to come to me again.
why did i think a person only distantly like me
might finally represent my life? what aspects
of my attitudes, my cast of mind, my inconclusive
way of tossing questions at the world had i
supposed might realize another person’s fantasies
and turn her into someone else—who gradually became
a separate part of me, and argued with the very
words i would have used, and looked at me through
eyes i’d looked at as though gazing at myself?
i guess we only realize ourselves in dreams,
or in these self-reflexive reveries sustaining
all the charms that contemplation holds—until the
long enchantment of the soul with what it sees
is lifted, and it startles at a space alight with
objects of its infantile gaze, like people in a mall.
i saw her just the other day. i felt a kind of
comfort at her face, one tinctured with bemusement
at the strange and guarded person she’d become—
attractive, vaguely friendly, brisk (too brisk),
but no one i could think might represent my life.
why did i even try to see myself in what’s outside?
the strangeness pushes it away, propels the vision
back upon itself, into these regions filled with
shapes that i can wander through and never see,
as though their image were inherently unreal.
the houses on a street, the quiet backyard shade,
the room restored to life with bric-a-brac—
i started by revisiting these things, then slowly
reconceiving them as forms of loss made visible
that balanced sympathy and space inside an
abstract edifice combining reaches of the past
with all these speculations, all this artful
preening of the heart. i sit here at my desk,
perplexed and puzzled, teasing out a tangled
skein of years we wove together, and trying to
combine the fragments of those years into a poem.
who cares if life—if someone’s actual life—is
finally insignificant and small? there’s still a
splendor in the way it flowers once and fades
and leaves a carapace behind. there isn’t time to
linger over why it happened, or attempt to make its
mystery come to life again and last, like someone
still embracing the confused perceptions of himself
embedded in the past, as though eternity lay there—
for heaven’s a delusion, and eternity is in the details,
and this tiny, insubstantial life is all there is.
—and that would be enough, but for the reoccurring
dreams i often have of you. sometimes at night
the banished unrealities return, as though a room
suffused with light and poetry took shape around me.
pictures line the walls. it’s early summer.
somewhere in remembrance of things past, marcel,
reflecting on his years with “albertine”—with x—
suggests that love is just a consciousness of distance,
of the separation of two lives in time and space.
i think the same estrangement’s mirrored in each life,
in how it seems both adequate and incomplete—part
day-to-day existence, part imaginary construct
beckoning at night, and sighing through my dreams
like some disconsolate chimera, or the subject
of a lonely, terrifying sadness; or the isolation
of a quiet winter evening, when the house feels empty,
and silence intervenes. but in the wonderful
enclosure opening in my heart, i seem to recognize
our voices lilting in the yard, inflected by the
rhythms of a song whose words are seamless
and whose lines are never-ending. i can almost
see the contours of your face, and sense the
presence of the trees, and reimagine all of us
together in a deep, abiding happiness, as if the
three of us inhabited a fragile, made-up world
that seemed to be so permanent, so real.
i have this fantasy: it’s early in the evening.
you and i are sitting in the backyard, talking.
friends arrive, then drinks and dinner, conversation…the lovely summer twilight lasts forever…what’s the use?
what purpose do these speculations serve? what
mild enchantments do these meditations leave?
they’re just the murmurs of an age, of middle age,
that help to pass the time that they retrieve
before subsiding, leaving everything unchanged.
each of us at times has felt the future fade,
or seen the compass of his life diminished,
or realized some tangible illusion was unreal.
driving down to evanston last week, i suddenly
remembered driving down that road eight years ago,
so caught up in some story i’d just finished
that i’d missed the way the countryside was changing—
how in place of trees there now were office towers
and theme parks, parts of a confusingly panoply of
barns and discount malls transfiguring a landscape
filled with high, receding clouds and rows of flimsy
houses in what used to be a field. i thought of
other people’s lives, and how impossible it seemed
to grasp them on the model of my own—as little
mirrors of infinity—or sense their forms of
happiness, or in their minor personal upheavals
feel the sweep of time reduced to human scale
and see its abstract argument made visible.
i thought of overarching dreams of plenitude—
how life lacks shape until it’s given one by love,
and how each soul is both a kingdom in itself
and part of some incorporating whole that
feels and has a face and lets it live forever.
all of these seemed true, and cancelled one another,
leaving just the feeling of an unseen presence
tracing out the contours of a world erased,
like music tracing out the contours of the mind—﻿
for life has the form of a winding curve in space
and in its wake the human figure disappears.
look at our surroundings—where a previous age
could visualize a landscape we see borders,
yet i think the underlying vision is the same:
a person positing a world that he can see
and can’t contain, and vexed by other people.
everything is possible; some of it seemed real
or nearly real, yet in the end it spoke to me alone,
in phrases echoing the isolation of a meager
ledge above a waterfall, or rolling across a vast,
expanding plain on which there’s always room,
but only room for one. it starts and ends
inside an ordinary room, while in the interim
brimming with illusions, filled with commonplace
delights that make the days go by, with simple
arguments and fears, and with the nervous
inkling of some vague, utopian conceit
transforming both the landscape and our lives,
until we look around and find ourselves at home,
but in a wholly different world. and even those
catastrophes that seemed to alter everything
seem fleeting, grounded in a natural order
all of us are subject to, and ought to celebrate.
—yet why? that things are temporary doesn’t
render them unreal, unworthy of regretting.
it’s not as though the past had never happened:
all those years were real, and their loss was real,
and it is sad—i don’t know what else to call it.
i’m glad that both of us seem happy. yet what
troubles me is just the way what used to be a world
turned out, in retrospect, to be a state of mind,
and no more tangible than that. and now it’s gone,
and in its place i find the image of a process
of inexorable decay, or of some great unraveling
that drags the houses forward into emptiness
and backwards into pictures of the intervening days
love pieced together out of nothing. and i’m
certain that this austere vision finally is true,
and yet it strikes me as too meager to believe.
it comes from much too high above the world
and seems to me too hopeless, too extreme—
but then i found myself one winter afternoon
remembering a quiet morning in a classroom
and inventing everything again, in ordinary
terms that seemed to comprehend a childish
dream of love, and then the loss of love,
and all the intricate years between.

they’re all dressed up in carmine floor-length velvet gowns, their upswirled hair festooned with matching ribbons: their fresh hopes and our fond hopes for them infuse this sort-of-music as if happiness could actually be each-plays-her-part-and-all-will-take-care-of-itself. their hearts unscarred under quartz lights beam through the darkness in which we sit to show us why we endured at home the squeaking and squawking and botched notes that now in concert are almost beautiful, almost rendering this heartrending music composed for an archduke who loved it so much he spent his fortune for the musicians who could bring it brilliantly to life.

side by side through the streets at midnight, roaming together, through the tumultuous night of london, in the miraculous april weather. roaming together under the gaslight, day’s work over, how the spring calls to us, here in the city, calls to the heart from the heart of a lover! cool to the wind blows, fresh in our faces, cleansing, entrancing, after the heat and the fumes and the footlights, where you dance and i watch your dancing. good it is to be here together, good to be roaming, even in london, even at midnight, lover-like in a lover’s gloaming. you the dancer and i the dreamer, children together, wandering lost in the night of london, in the miraculous april weather. ﻿

we have walked in love's land a little way, we have learnt his lesson a little while, and shall we not part at the end of day, with a sigh, a smile?
a little while in the shine of the sun, we were twined together, joined lips, forgot how the shadows fall when the day is done, and when love is not.
we have made no vows--there will none be broke, our love was free as the wind on the hill, there was no word said we need wish unspoke, we have wrought no ill.
so shall we not part at the end of day, who have loved and lingered a little while, join lips for the last time, go our way, with a sigh, a smile? ﻿

loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show, that she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain, pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know, knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,—i sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe, studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain, oft turning others’ leaves, to see if thence would flow some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain. but words came halting forth, wanting invention’s stay: invention, nature’s child, fled step-dame study’s blows, and others’ feet still seemed but strangers in my way. thus great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes, biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite: “fool,” said my muse to me, “look in thy heart and write.”

i must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky, and all i ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by; and the wheel’s kick and the wind’s song and the white sail’s shaking, and a grey mist on the sea’s face, and a grey dawn breaking.
i must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied; and all i ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying, and the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.
i must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life, to the gull’s way and the whale’s way where the wind’s like a whetted knife; and all i ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover, and quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick’s over.

we are the music makers,
and we are the dreamers of dreams,
wandering by lone sea-breakers,
and sitting by desolate streams; —
world-losers and world-forsakers,
on whom the pale moon gleams:
yet we are the movers and shakers
of the world for ever, it seems.
with wonderful deathless ditties
we build up the world's great cities,
and out of a fabulous story
we fashion an empire's glory:
one man with a dream, at pleasure,
shall go forth and conquer a crown;
and three with a new song's measure
can trample a kingdom down.
we, in the ages lying,
in the buried past of the earth,
built nineveh with our sighing,
and babel itself in our mirth;
and o'erthrew them with prophesying
to the old of the new world's worth;
for each age is a dream that is dying,
or one that is coming to birth.
a breath of our inspiration
is the life of each generation;
a wondrous thing of our dreaming
unearthly, impossible seeming —
the soldier, the king, and the peasant
are working together in one,
till our dream shall become their present,
and their work in the world be done.
they had no vision amazing
of the goodly house they are raising;
they had no divine foreshowing
of the land to which they are going:
but on one man's soul it hath broken,
a light that doth not depart;
and his look, or a word he hath spoken,
wrought flame in another man's heart.
and therefore to-day is thrilling
with a past day's late fulfilling;
and the multitudes are enlisted
in the faith that their fathers resisted,
and, scorning the dream of to-morrow,
are bringing to pass, as they may,
in the world, for its joy or its sorrow,
the dream that was scorned yesterday.
but we, with our dreaming and singing,
ceaseless and sorrowless we!
the glory about us clinging
of the glorious futures we see,
our souls with high music ringing:
o men! it must ever be
that we dwell, in our dreaming and singing,
a little apart from ye.
for we are afar with the dawning
and the suns that are not yet high,
and out of the infinite morning
intrepid you hear us cry —
how, spite of your human scorning,
once more god's future draws nigh,
and already goes forth the warning
that ye of the past must die.
great hail! we cry to the comers
from the dazzling unknown shore;
bring us hither your sun and your summers;
and renew our world as of yore;
you shall teach us your song's new numbers,
and things that we dreamed not before:
yea, in spite of a dreamer who slumbers,
and a singer who sings no more.

i think it is interesting
though not exactly amusing
how we go from day to day
with no money. how do we
do it, friends ask, suspecting
we really have some stash
stacked away somewhere.
but we certainly do not
and we also do not know
how we do it either.
you sure are lucky,
some of our friends say. i am
none too sure of that though,
as i wait for the winning
lottery numbers to be announced
on cklw. thursday in detroit
is the day of dreams. we have
been dreaming of a place
in the country lately and i’m
none too sure that is very healthy.
and speaking of health that’s
also been a problem that probably
has something to do with no money,
since we’ve all been sick lately,
taking turns politely of course.
could you bring me some more
tea one of us will ask,
and the other will.
in between the coughing and
worrying our thoughts
have often turned to crime.
we seriously wonder how we can
get away with a bundle with
as little risk as possible.
last week we took our last
$12 out of the bank
and noticed how much more
they had there though
we had none. of course
we wouldn’t rob that bank,
they know us there
as the ones who bring
the rolls of pennies in.
and just yesterday they
fish-eyed us for trying
to cash our son’s xmas bond
from his grandparents
after only one month.
so we wouldn’t try to rob that bank,
but i do know of one up north
that may be possible. . .
i know this just seems like
romantic dreaming
but i practically make a career
of reading detective stories,
and god knows, i have no other.
anyway if the right opportunity
comes along, we are more
than ready to meet it.
but this is a time of waiting,
the i ching says, though it does
not say how we are to eat
while waiting. and soon
we will have another mouth to feed—
ann now in her seventh month,
and that is often in our thoughts.
besides all that we are both
over thirty, artist and poet,
still waiting to cross the great water.
meanwhile, day after day,
there is still detroit
to be dealt with — a small pond
says our friend snee.
big fish we used to answer him,
but that was a while back.
now we think maybe lake erie
is the great water referred to
in the i ching, and if we wait
long enough we can
walk across — to buffalo
or cleveland. in a healthy person,
says the philosopher, self-pity
can be a forerunner to action:
once the problem is seen clearly,
a solution may be found at hand.
and as i said, i think it is interesting
though not exactly amusing.

in the days of long ago, ranged where the locomotives sing and the prairie flowers lie low:—the tossing, blooming, perfumed grass is swept away by the wheat, wheels and wheels and wheels spin by in the spring that still is sweet. but the flower-fed buffaloes of the spring left us, long ago. they gore no more, they bellow no more, they trundle around the hills no more:—with the blackfeet, lying low, with the pawnees, lying low, lying low.

i set up my computer and webcam in the kitchen so i can ask my mother’s and aunt’s advice as i cook soup for the first time alone. my mother is in utah. my aunt is in hungary. i show the onions to my mother with the webcam. “cut them smaller,” she advises. “you only need a taste.” i chop potatoes as the onions fry in my pan. when i say i have no paprika to add to the broth, they argue whether it can be called potato soup. my mother says it will be white potato soup, my aunt says potato soup must be red. when i add sliced peppers, i ask many times if i should put the water in now, but they both say to wait until i add the potatoes. i add polish sausage because i can’t find hungarian, and i cook it so long the potatoes fall apart. “you’ve made stew,” my mother says when i hold up the whole pot to the camera. they laugh and say i must get married soon. i turn off the computer and eat alone.

i can hear him, now, even in darkness, a trickster under the moon, bristling his feathers, sounding as merry as a man whistling in a straw hat, or a squeaky gate to the playground, left ajar or the jingling of a star, having wandered too far from the pasture.

it unfolds and ripples like a banner, downward. all the stories
come folding out. the smells and flowers begin to come back, as
the tapestry is brightly colored and brocaded. rabbits and violets.
who asked you to come over? she got her foot in the door and
would not remove it, elbowing and talking swiftly. gas leak?
that sounds like a very existential position; perhaps you had
better check with the landlord.
this was no better than the
predicament i had just read about. now it was actually changing
before my eyes. sometimes it will come to a standstill though,
and finally the reflection can begin.
selfless—that was the proposition. smiling and moving instantly
there was no other purpose than that which brought them there,
to be in a particular place.
this time the mule gave its face away. take your cadillac
where you want to go in the morning, convertible as it might be,
and enjoy a good bottle of rum.
running on this way she used various modes of expression that
were current. nothing seemed to bring the woods any closer.
what woods, she was questioned, realizing that as far as the
woods went, they were largely inhabitable through the facility
of her mind. at the philadelphia flower show, an ideal situation
was built up. here through various regulated artificial conditions,
spring grass, waterfalls, the newly-sprouted bulbs completed
her ideal concept of nature. the smell was overpowering.
all right then. she had a thing about nature, from flower
show glamor and enormous greenhouses the rich cultivated.
a beauty of cultivation—in living? hastiness did not prevent
her from rising quick and ready to misnomers and other odd
conclusions, throwing the telephone book to the floor, “oh oh
the life i am entangled in.” four sides of it.
above was a paradisical
level, incompleted. with working possibilities.
below, endless preoccupations and variations were possible.
currently in vogue were shelves, the vacuum cleaner, a new
bedspread and color scheme for pillows.
taste treats were
unresponsive. glamor do’s were out. conversation was nil.
languid
she could not even find a place to languish upon that was
fulfilling in its own way.
so out of the lifelessness that was around her,
the grape leaves drying out, and even though the avocado was
sprouting,
she thought, why not fantasy? tugging at this character and
that, trying to push a little life in a prince or a charmer, a half-
blind bat, dryad, the works of the story teller. here the four
walls of the room and ceiling became apparent again. “i ought
to tighten down and make sure i say exactly what i mean.”
and her face took on a tight pinched expression, and thrifty scotch
economy gave her shrewd eyes in the prescribed way. use every
tidbit, usefully. once upon a time there was a princess who
had a long white fur coat with a high fluffy collar, and inside the
coat were stitched beautiful butterflies in many bright colors.
the princess languished. she was not sure where to sit to her best
advantage to enjoy herself the most. she could not go in her mind
or out. she looked at her long white hand, i am the queen of the
high mountain hag, she murmured to herself, still knowing she was
a princess. she lay down upon the floor as if it were the garden of
eden, the coat spread around her.
no, that poor little house she
had built was a bore. it’s better that it go up in flames, as it did.
she went down to grand central station and gave away flowers.
some people took them and some people didn’t.
i’m glad to get back. i had to repeat a rough discontinuous journey.
questioning myself all along the way. was i jumping on her because
her time had come to an end. indeed i pounded on his arm all night,
over his concern for this soft-spoken individual, i can see nothing
but their softness. me me, and the time we might spend together,
reading and talking, to tear away that putrid husk.
my flippancy is gone. now i have started my secret life again,
in transition, reminding. as the moth reminds, its feeble antenna
groping, taken like a stalk of fern, coins of money.
all over i was shaking as the fear and tension made itself apparent.
it was a cold night out. it was colder still between the airy gaps,
between blankets.
you can see she is thoughtful
as she draws the string to the bow. where to go indeed. the
point is brought forward and discussed very cleverly.
a sleeping angel or a sleeping troll? i was rather proud of being
used, pushing the clothing hampers up and down the downtown
street. here, pleasant mentors conveyed their anxious solicitations,
drawing from their bags, long lists of memorandum due, what i owed.
it was a lot, if i hesitated. i choose to go on, saying this is the
way i go, owing nothing, being that kind of person. hung up?
that thought intrudes as the clearly marked vista is not so clearly
marked. certainly one supposes in all honesty, that an essential
core of feeling blooms in each encounter. lost under the weight
of the garbage of who are you that you are not making apparent.
thus unhappy, i don’t want it to be this way, and so forth.
not costumes, or paraphernalia, the immediate reactions.
we of course are in a family situation. anything i wish might
happen, but the larger situations are not real, not to be
considered possible, discussable as to what sense of reality
they possessed.
in the snow, the wood piled up underneath. oh those drifting
sensibilities. at this point it is scarcely believable that people
gather and like each other. eating chocolate pudding, getting
in touch with some other sense of alikeness. the form is no
longer obvious to me. whether they meander or are joined together
in their senses in the mechanics or regular grooves they run along.
i suspect that in this house, this
place that is musty and left as it was some years ago, there is
no real fear; the objects are old and i am not familiar with them,
only the sense that the ghost or spirit world strikes you with
its familiarity, pleasurable fear.
here the familiar
is apt to make its presence known, at any moment the unexpected
lurk in the hall, into the room. pieces of leather, old silken fans
laid upon the table top, rooms filled with something left unexpectedly
terror is the wrong combination of ignorance. it contains its own
self with dusty fragments of velvet and fringe. 100 pieces of voice
with no name, called it myself, as they spoke all day, sucking the
soft slush, admitting their real deficiencies as—
i am never sure; oh it’s that power
and disease of believing in the stale that doesn’t demand a real
climate, takes its capacity when the demons come down.
the night passes in night time. the head moving to the shoulder,
the head rising with a frown.
in a firm voice, it doesn’t matter if the hair is flying from undue
spring breezes, the self has been raptured on the wine that produces
appropriate madness, and sad she says, my dear the bacchanal is a
lovely way to be rid of waste.
however, in seeing the house more manageable, one cannot even have
fear larger than the unknown portions of the continent which
refuses to sink.
there once was a woman
who grew older, not that she minded, but the passage of time was
always constant. why does one have to contend with that she said,
puzzled, as she got carried along, and constantly had to think up
new coping modes of behavior. if he behaved to me thus when he was
40, now that i am 30, i can hardly behave like that to those that are
20, and so forth. there wasn’t any model except the one she built,
and one could scarcely believe there was no established pattern. this
offered wonderful possibilities, but also indecision and gutlessness.
you can’t see them, all bundled up, all those that choose
to move other than where the distance seems appealing. knowledge
has no depth. there isn’t any message to be spoken.
wrangling, she speaks ill-advised my dear, as the cat has no
point in laying its head down. she ought to watch carefully.
the claws. it could be
the bent hands, as they grow, that as the fur impeaches the
rose, doesn’t make the thing she hangs her body on any realer.
what could it be all about? the necessity to follow, balancing,
contemplating words, as the basis of why we move at all.
just a little touch. the leader cautioned further progression.
i could hardly listen to the music for long. now there
seemed to be interruptions, pleasurable interludes, nothing
definite, of a fragmented nature.
certainly i wished the best
for all. the sadder soldiers stumbled idly, as i also in the
profound reaches of my slumber noted the elegant turns, the
twisting statements grooving into the language building something
to listen to. the dress made from silk. trusting was awkward
and not of a nature to ease any further building. whosoever
you revere will come back tenfold upon you and lighten the
burden carried as those who desire the warmth and necessity of
communication.
i am sure my dreams must have been of the wrong sort. however, as
dreams are reflections of inner dilemmas, how did those arise, from
a day of relaxation and summer enjoyment of the fund.
knowledge comes from what purported strike? from that which cleanses,
and let us knot say “heart” but tissue. hopefully and helpfully i have
built up a language in which to talk myself to sleep. not for purposes
of letting in the cold.
however, i have found that not all blockaded
against is the cold, the dreary reign of the dead, etc., and tasteless
realm of the mushroom. as much can be denied as the bilious sun
strives to cause an enlargement of singing in the back of the neck and
the head. that is uncorraled ecstasy. i call it enthusiasm, free energy.
but it has no place to land, it is bursting and unfocused; it is a real force
and the counterpart of the gloomy depths.
as the pieces of the house
ooze sap, blossoms and green twigs burst from the cracks. whether or
not to join in what i was half committed to see and do.
at this point, when jack picked up the pussy willow branches, i said
they can’t possibly be ours for the taking, and smiled with dedication
to an older con edison man. the buildings were like the unexplored
garbage in my mind, fascinating and dirty, pulling pieces of cloth
from boxes left overnight. energy as limitless possibility, in
the attempt to transmit non-energy situations.
for example, if once i stop to realize what little gets through, i am
much more interested in the cover than the contents; it is difficult
to find any interest in anything. good energy displaces bad karma.
and other non entities like that sort, producing flow that in its own
place has a good bed, stocked well with what can be called fleet-footed
fishes, and approaching places of investigation, such as relations
between.
as i saw the blood flow to the surface of his skin, i
forgot to watch for the telltale visions that again might come from
something i have never seen; more possibly the components of what
every man views. if this was a possibility, the rays from every person
converging pass through the state of shock to numbness to unity without
any mind at all, for this horror fits the cat on the stairs, between
the fifth and sixth rung. this is the way people glow and pulse similar
to an inlet of jellyfish blocking the way, full of human life; until
i who will name myself a swimmer come along and refuse to be
blocked on the way, although i turn back gladly, and will again swim
through for it is possible they do not kill, the sting’s compounded measure
is fear, and thus one not need join the broad expanse of human mouths
calling people to join their ranks to comfort their newfound recognition
or orifices, stomachs and legs.
i reminded myself twice there were several stories that kept continuing
themselves. she ignored her face, blotched and red upon times, but
fuller. did you forget to wax and wane? her head was full of energy
brought forward and positively that what was said would turn the obvious
into color, but no sense. sense was for the thinkers. here the thinkers
forgot their word orders or sense; it was better to give them coffee,
and those off worse could smoke.
i had felt very
foolish when i leaned forward and grasped his hand, with effort, and
his cloak slipped down over one shoulder as he shouted, which is the
way. and i followed for certainly no one would follow me. as the day
is cold and colder, and what comes out of the head is of its own sort and
nature. these words, like nature, and head, thinking and words,
repeat themselves, as the lines of landscape, attics and other closed-off
sections have reprimanded themselves by repetition. light
was such an enormous possibility. taking sight into a frenzy, it was
possible that just to look was full of excitement and wonder, for
ages at a time, things appeared as beautiful, the sky, the street
where cars had gone by.
i worried about certain characters: ones
that never seemed to be other than puzzles to me but i was drawn to
them with certainty only because there seemed to be no understanding?
as when the mysteries were performed, the house then itself became
distilled with reason as the pots and pans were used apparently filled
with the stuff of continuity. the sorrow that each day sinks into the
infertile other side of day, where voice comes out of the dark, and
does its rituals. memory has its own screen across the room to view
itself, and the continuous dwelling of conjecture takes permanent form
in stiff-legged walks to remind, thus on and on the breathing goes.

in tamalpais is a big crystal. an acquaintance told
me the story. a miwok was giving his grandfather’s medicine
bag to the kroeber museum in berkeley. he said this man
took him over the mountain tamalpais, at a certain time
in the year. i believe it was about the time of the
winter solstice, because then the tides are really low.
they stopped and gathered a certain plant on the way over
the mountain. on their way to the bolinas beach clam patch,
where there is a big rock way out there.
go out to
the rock. take out of the medicine bag the crystal
that matches the crystal in tamalpais. and
if your heart is not true
if your heart is not true
when you tap the rock in the clam patch
a little piece of it will fly off
and strike you in the heart
and strike you dead.
and that’s the first story i ever heard about bolinas.

the grasses are light brown
and the ocean comes in
long shimmering lines
under the fleet from last night
which dozes now in the early morning
here and there horses graze
on somebody’s acreage
strangely, it was not my desire
that bade me speak in church to be released
but memory of the way it used to be in
careless and exotic play
when characters were promises
then recognitions. the world of transformation
is real and not real but trusting.
enough of these lessons? i mean
didactic phrases to take you in and out of
love’s mysterious bonds?
well i myself am not myself
and which power of survival i speak
for is not made of houses.
it is inner luxury, of golden figures
that breathe like mountains do
and whose skin is made dusky by stars.

when i used to focus on the worries, everybody
was ahead of me, i was the bottom
of the totem pole,
a largely spread squat animal.
how about a quick massage now, he said to me.
i don’t think it’s cool, i replied.
oh, said he, after a pause, i should have waited
for you to ask me.
the waves came in closer and closer.
when i fall into the gap of suspicion i am no longer here.
in this world that has got closed over by houses
and networks, i fly out
from under the belly.
life’s dizzy crown
of whirling lights, circles this head.
pure
with wonder, hot
with wonder.
the streets become golden.
all
size increases, the colors glow, we are in myth.
we are in easy understanding.
scarcely talking, thoughts pass between us.
it is memory.
as i search to find
this day’s sweet drifting.
the fog out to sea, the wind.
