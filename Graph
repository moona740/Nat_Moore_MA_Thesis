Follow a sine wave's journey through the sea of *Sea and Spar Between* at the following link: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/y4pirwqjdq 
If the wave intersects with the coordinates of a stanza, read that stanza at https://nickm.com/montfort_strickland/sea_and_spar_between/
(For instructions on how to navigate the poem, see http://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=sea-and-spar-between)
Stanzas from [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1) ... (1000, 1), [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0) ... (1000, 0)], and [(0, -1), (1, -1), (2, -1) ... (1000, -1)]
have been plotted on the graph. If you reach 1000 on the x-axis and wish to continue operating the poem in the manner prescribed here
edit variable A from [1...1000] - [1...1000] to [1001...2000) - [1001...2000], variable B from [1...1000] to [1001...2000].
*Mutatis mutandis* for the other variables. *Mutatis mutandis* if you reach 2000 on the x-axis are still unsatiated.
